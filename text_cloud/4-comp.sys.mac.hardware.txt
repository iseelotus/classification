re nutek faces apple s wrath article read in article davea davea xetron com david p alverson writes i believe apple has a patent on the region features of quickdraw a mac clone would have to implement regions this is why apple s comment was that they believe it is not possible to make a mac clone without infringing on their patents they may have other patents like this apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably includes the internal data structure which has never been officially documented by apple apple cannot patent the concept of a region i m guessing that either nutek reverse engineered apple s internal data structure for regions i dunno if this would hold up in court or they came up with their own data structure if it s the latter then they won t be able to draw pict files containing regions besides pict files there aren t many places where regions are stored on disk quicktime movies perhaps as long as the region isn t being stored on disk and transferred from a mac to a nutek clone or vice versa it doesn t matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port what other patents does apple have on the mac joe schwartz e mail xor acm rpi edu or xor clotho acm rpi edu mapinfo corp

session do you need one for that too if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multi session capability to read the second session whether it is photos or just data or whatever here is a simplified way of looking at it the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks the second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still exists because you cannot change only add so if you put that in a normal drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last

four months ago i purchased a quantum lps hd from la cie for after two months the drive started having problems first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining wouldn t even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i then insert the silverlining program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd i ve called la cie again and they ve given me another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn t see the drive there s a definite hardware problem given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these facts events have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send i think the data is still in good shape and i ll have to again reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me for data recovery it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a day warranty should be new i feel a little helpless about all this i don t mean to necessarily flame la cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but c mon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent a letter to la cie s customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didn t even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other what s the moral of this story i m not sure but i do know i won t buy any other products from la cie in the future bill krauthammer f ehg umiami ir miami edu

doctrine but there s something kind of similar to show infringement one element you need to show is that the defendant copied from your work if you re lucky you ll have direct evidence of copying the smoking gun normally you do this through circumstantial evidence by showing evidence of access from which one might reasonably infer copying this evidence of access is considered along with the similarities between the two works in deciding whether you copied however if the similarities are so strong as to be striking an inference of copying may be drawn even without any evidence that the defendant had access to your copyrighted work in that case the burden will be on the defendant to rebut the inference of copying for example evidence that he d been on a desert island for the last ten

wanted a centris the lack of an fpu on that machine and the price struck me as making it worth less than an lciii so i have suggested we get a iivx instead it seems heavily expandable and for what do people with iivx s think of them they seem like good machines to me and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do work with video on it the iivx lciii performance at a centris price the only reason to get an iivx is if you really need the full size nubus slots keep in mind that the supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet this lessens but doesn t eliminate the need for nubus cards and unless you re running fpu intensive software the will blow the doors off the lciii and the iivx the lciii on the other hand is sufficient for most people and has a great price

does someone already have one made up the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter i m assuming that the powerbooks duos will work with the same adapter macintosh lc to vga the macintosh lc can supply a x vga timed signal for use with vga monitors by using an adapter cable the standard macintosh lc supports vga to colors and with the optional k vram simm the vga monitor is supported to colors note the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level inputs however some low impedance input vga monitors do not work with the macintosh lc to connect a macintosh lc

pin signal name red ground red video signal green video signal green ground blue video signal blue ground hsync vsync hsync ground nc sense sense tied together vga monitors are identified by shorting

this is an aside to brian hughes s please let s lose the cute phony names everybody posting about adding memory to a quadra what phony names my name is clearly visible in the headers and i sing the post with my account name if you have a problem with that then you will have to get over it i ve used this account name for over years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last generally recognize hades as my account name i have no intention of changing the way i post i installed a couple of mb simms in my quadra and was somewhat dismayed by the general complexity of the operation compared to for example the wonderfully designed lc iii it irritates me when apple refuses to tell how to do it in the user s manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble the devise in question it s the same for adding memory to laserwriter pro s it isn t apple s responsibility to tell its customers how to fool around with it s hardware that is what apple service techs get paid to do i personally like the design of the q and applaud apple for coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of those drive bays i like it a lot better than the design except for those people who need drive arrays i do however agree with you about the lw pro design the operation isn t very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were offered but apple leaves you working blind again its s not apple s place to make it easy for non certified service people to fool around with apple hardware even if they did buy it of course you are free to do what you want to your mac just don t get upset when your apple service rep tells you that your warranty is no longer valid after the memory was installed i was distraught that the top of the simms came into contact with the plastic case frame mine actually contacted the framework with quite a lot of pressure enough so that the assembly of the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required some force i could have filed a little excess material off the top of the simm boards but chose to let it stand as is i have not had problems with ram yet so i will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic this sounds like the kind of problem i had when i installed mb simms into an lc back before low profile mb simms were readily available the standard mb simms would contact the top of the case and make it a bit difficult to close the lc but it did close and work just fine one of the nice things about logic boards is that they are generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount

hooked up to the computer or not the lps makes a disk seek noise every seconds this is consistent and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered up even if i disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity continues at second intervals someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a thermal recalibration not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest disk drive technology i guess i might believe anything whats the scoop on this standalone drive activity every sec i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it this becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and so was used primarily on very large capacity mechanisms but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive s long term reliability and mtbf ratings i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing say audio or video to hard disk some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes hope this helps victorext hard drives for my se i m interested in getting an external hard drive for my se i ve got an internal mb that s

with file icons being lost but it s hard to say whether it s the board s fault or something else however if i decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board the icon usually reappears because of the above mentioned licensing problem the freeware expansion utility dd expand will not decompress a board compressed file unless you have the board installed since stac has its

that the current version that is shipping is owners of the older drives can get an upgrade it does not come with any free cd s unless you buy it in a bundle of the three cd rom drives above i think

can pump data in to mac memory at mb s using block mode transfers i have a high speed disk array no asynchronous pb calls that can achieve mb s let s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer then transfer all the data from the buffer to card mb s then mb s result in an overall mb s too slow so i tried the following scheme for an n megabyte transfer step load the st mb from disk to buffer step asynch send st mb out card load the nd mb from disk to buffer step asynch send nd mb out card load the rd mb from disk to buffer step n asynch send the n mb out card load the nth mb from disk to buffer step n send the nth mb out card even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously and the card does not use the mac cpu at all it is using the buffer tho each of the steps through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another so there is no improvement in the rate why is the mac ram dual port so the nubus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time is the problem that the two devices card and disk driver both have to

the default apple cache card i believe this is k say i have my cache set at meg what good does a measly k do me on the cache card could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the simm s or does it still speed things up by providing a secondary staging area for data normally passed directly into the simm ram cache i m confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself yet daystar fastcache has numbers which show around a performance boost on some operations are the chips on the cache card

constantly rebooting themselves as if the reboot button were being pushed sometimes the mac is able to fully boot and display the desktop but it is only a matter of time before it reboots again at times the frequency is as high as several times a minute i wonder if your mac has those little reset interupt switches installed they are plastic devices that push on the switches which are inside the mac or mabey those switches are bad and need replacing this problem is usually a low vdc from the power supply there is an adjustment for this on the supply if the voltage is still unstable or low

there s no change in its setting there it s still on full speed the way i like it restarting the machine restores the normal mouse speed by the way it happens with both the newer style mouse that came with the centris and the older style mouse from my iifx at work thus i don t think it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouse it s definitely a quirk of the adb interface either

completely flat have any detrimental side effects other than the pb not going i ask only two things i can think of although nicad c batteries should be completely discharged about once a month leadacid batteries shouldn t ever be completely discharged well maybe once in a while is okay this is a very common mis conception dealing with ni cad batteries it is a good idea to completely discharge a ni cad cell periodically it is not a good idea to completely discharge a ni cad battery the difference being that a cell is only one cell nicad puts out volts like a rechargeable aaa aa c or d a battery is defined as more than one cell volt or for nicad equivalent due to differences in the individual cells of a battery complete discharge can actually harm a nicad battery more than help it overcome the memory effect the most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop internal shorts which will weaken other cells that are connected to it thus reducing the lifespan

they buy below dealer cost as a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well the lowest prices i have been quoted

it will be working from a single mac but networkability would probably be a good investment for the future with that in mind anyone have comments about the suitability quality value of a gcc blp elite printer i just recently purchased the gcc blp elite and i really like it my needs are much the same as what you describe in addition i wanted to get one that i could access via appletalk so that eliminated the new line of inexpensive printers from apple the print quality is good to excellent based on what font you re using and what paper you use i m still experimenting with different papers but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work fine printing envelopes transpariencies letter head or other single feed jobs is very easy there is an adjustable automatic centering guide on top of the sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly and doesn t feed a sheet from the sheet feeder as some do i have no affiliation with gcc just a satisfied customer earl d fife department of

since there were so many mails about problems with this board my questions does the board work with and a ux does anybody know problems with any kind of software well i haven t seen any reports of problems with the turbo but to my knowledge daystar has not released a version of the board that works with anything but the iisi and iici and they have not finished tweaking testing for use with a ux this may not happen until the a ux upgrade is released my guess so i d recommend waiting or buying the mhz board and upgrade later when a ux compatibility is assured turbo interface cards for the ii iix se iicx etc will probably be available sooner but if a ux compatibility is a requirement it is probably best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer an added advantate of waiting for the daystar for the se is that just as with the power cache the accelerator will plug into the cpu socket leaving the pds slot free for a video card or ethernet card with daystar s upgrade path it s a no

sensory organs stuff deleted another alternative is the use of the sound input port can you really make due with the non existent dynamic range of an bit converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps ac coupled as well it clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine the critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency maximum about action potentials per seconds and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape so the resolution of about you get with an bit convertor is more then sufficient ac coupling does not have to be a problem either since in many cases you are not interested in the dc level my pre amplifier is ac coupled also the critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass if the cutoff point is to high the action potentials will be slightly distorted but even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is important however

article br a auvm american edu br a auvm american edu writes the trackbal on my pb no longer moves in the horizontal direction when i called the nearest authorized apple service person i was told that it probably needed replacing and that would cost me over ouch can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem one strange symptom of the problem is that when i take the ball out of the socket and shine a light into the hole i can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the wheel with my finger it works fine that way but won t work if i turn off the light any suggestions or comments ben roy just a poor college student internet br a american edu ben since you re obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works the only thing short of repairing it that i can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers since they aren t fixed in position on their stainless steel pins you might try sliding them into a slightly different position on my powerbook i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball in fact one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its edge contacts the ball not the center cylindrical area i ve done this with my pb and it does seem to improve the feel but needs to be adjusted from time to time i just popped open one of our office s pb s and while there isn t as much latitude for movement one could still adjust the roller slightly if your pb is the same it might help i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller if you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl alcohol also be sure the ball is grease free if you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin if all this still doesn t solve it then maybe a new one is in order it could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be necessary but my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem not an electrical malfunction hope this helps murray murray m altheim ils

baset you ll probably also need terminators apple s transceivers are self terminated if i remember correctly but i have no idea about decs the third party media adapters are usually cheaper at least in toronto than apple s i bought the adapters from asante instead of apple gurman umbra gsfc nasa gov joseph b gurman writes the decstation models and come with thinwire only can t say for certain about the models and so your best bet that s not true only the decstation comes with a thinwire bnc coaxial ethernet connector the and all have a single pin aui ethernet connector only i distinctly remembered this because when got the first and i thought all of them are going to be thinwire i eventually had to go back and ordered destas dec s oversized version of an aui to bnc adapter that must be used with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations my advise to the very original poster beverly is if all you want is to create a lan with two workstations and won t add machines to it ever go for thinwire regardless of the media type going for utp unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which means extra money and i believe these units come with at least ports as for thicknet it s a nightmare and cabling is expensive avoid it unless you have no choice e g the two machines are two floors parts on the mac side you will need one thinwire media adapter from apple or third party macx make sure you get version won t run on system mactcp which comes with macx if you get macx v you should be getting mactcp v with it don t use earlier versions on a centris you may or may not need a ohm terminator depending on the thinwire media adapter so just ask the sales if the adapter is self terminated or not configure mactcp to use ethernet on the decstation side you will need for a model you will only need a t connector for models you will need an aui to bnc adapter get one that can be plugged in directly to the aui port of the decstation this way you save the cost of

will be slow douce tfsquad mn org andrew geweke writes i cannot speak for dale but i am quite sure that the macintosh uses the full bit or bit data path to its full advantage that is it is running as fast with two or four pin simms as it would with one pin simm now it may be that longword accesses assuming a bit data path here get the first byte from the first simm the second byte from the second and so on this would mean that each longword of memory is actually split among four simms one for each byte on the other hand it could be that the simms are interleaved by word or longword not just by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory controller deals with the eight bit data path that each one has i suspect though that they are interleaved to some extent so that bits can be read or written at once this would indicate a byte level interleave i am not confusing this with the new machines longword interleave with two pin simms of the same sort although that seems to be the same sort of idea there you get an essential bit data path ro excuse me to ram instead of just a bit one yes the cpu can t handle it but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something up so dale am i right pin simms are interleaved by bytes allowing the full data bus or as is common with usenet and me in particular am i as clueless as everyone else what conclusion can be drawn from this

really don t want to do that if any brave souls out there have done this before please e mail your experience directly to me i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple s original keyboard is

expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running but if i can switch without any lock up problems then i could switch to mhz when needed and put it back to idle mhz when not needeed this would further reduce the wear and tear on the cpu even with a heat sink of course i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to

the upgrade costs just quoted from my dealer however the q upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to with bit depth and up to at bit depth with additional vram it also

disk recently crashed i reformatted silverlining but during the reformat i received random write errors during testing the error message reported was like sector write error detected after testing good sector not mapped out this occurred randomly all over the hard disk which makes me suspect the diagnostic s reference to sector on the third reformat and after reinstalling the scsi read write loops i was able to get through passes and with no errors pass for some reason reported a lot of errors but still mapped out no sectors i decided to go ahead and try to resinstall system and reload my data from a backup this proceded normally however i now have sub optimal performance symptoms include o frequent crashes o instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to correct o instances of not finding the disk on the scsi chain on reboot if i boot from norton utl after this occurs it cannot find the disk either the only thing that fixes this is recycling the power it sometimes requires several attempts questions has anyone had this type of problem before is the problem with the fx motherboard and its non standard scsi implementation or with my maxtor disk is there some diagnostic software that would help me make this determination is it a termination problem i currently have external syquest and an external dataframe xp on the chain the xp is at the end and has internal termination so i am not using the iifx terminator i do have the scsi filter installed on the internal drive i have run with this exact steup for years with one previous disk crash requiring a reformat about a year ago i also have symptoms if i disconnect the external devices so i don t see how scsi termination would now be an issue of course who knows help would be much appreciated forrest

ford described a two year effort by liam breck to document and bring to apple s attention a problem with certain defective mice at random the switches on these mice stick in the down position until clicked a second time apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in malaysia and have an fcc id of bcga you ll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you have such a mouse the problem is intermittent but it s not subtle liam breck recently gave up trying to document this problem and instead suggested that people contact apple s customer assistance center directly macweek p when i called apple on march rd and described my defective mouse i was eventually given a case number f y and told apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty after waiting for three weeks i called back today wondering where my new mouse was this time i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse mb fc is not within the undisclosed range apple is willing to replace and there is nothing i can do about it nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apple s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice please if you have one of these mice i need your help don t assume you know what causes the problem there are lots of theories and start hacking around inside your hundred dollar mouse instead let apple do it please take five minutes to call apple right now at united states canada uk and europe australia japan and pacific if the number isn t toll free call collect describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse even if they refuse insist that they register the details of your case including your mouse s serial number be firm network managers and user group leaders especially please query your user bases everyone ask your friends and colleagues please don t send mail to me or post yet another

purchased a lc iii and he wants to know if there is such a demon called nubus adapter for his pds slot the lc family of macs can only use pds cards they are not able to use nubus ah but why can some technically hip macslinger tell us what the difference is between pds and nubus is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a nubus card cage at least marvin s friend has not been able to locate one and neither have i what is the fundamental reason for this i think that there do exist nubus expansion cages i m sure i ve seen them advertised occassionally but i think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx so unless you need lots of nubus slots its not worth the bother of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive nubus technology isn t a special apple proprietry thing i have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments so there is no problem building an expansion box the difference between nubus and pds is that nubus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer pds processor direct slot is just that here are all the connections to the processor you can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be but there s no cooperation you may be able to get double pds slot adaptors but you try plugging video cards in and just watch them conflict of course the extra electronics in a nubus slot makes it appreciably more expensive so guess why apple doesn t put it in it s cheaper machines so yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice bill wis liverpool ac ukre put ex syquest in centris i ve just installed a tape

they were thinking of the cd caddies to hold a cd disk when you stick it in the drive as far as i can tell apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard device why not they advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the bay why not provide the faceplate they do sell a cutout for their cd rom drive of course but that s of no use i m going to

the u s a local magazine next magazine similar to newsweek here uses the mac extensively i have seen sir speedy and other franchises in hong kong equipped with mac based systems true the discount is not as steep as here because customers in hong kong cannot buy from gray market nor are mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like apple does here with the performa lin e at this point the sale of mac is handled by one exclusive distributor on the other hand you can always get a pc clone or in the earlier days illegal clones of the apple iie your perception of the mac not being too popular in hong kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell pc clones with probably illegal copies of bios than to pay for a mac similarly you cannot say lotus surely is not well accepted in hong kong because the sale is so low may be it is because of all those places in kowloon where illegal copies of lotus can be bought for and for a

zterm and a zyxel for close to two weeks now here s what i did once in zterm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to you ve probably already done this then i typed at d at w the first line sets the modem to ignore the dtr line necessary for hardware handshaking with most though not all mac hardware handshaking cables the second stores this setting in non volatile memory in the modem so it s the default when the modem starts in the modem preferences dialog i have the modem initialization string set to at z m which just insures that the stored setting is used useful if starting zterm after using something like the fax software or macwoof which change the settings in other ways alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just set the zterm initialization string to at d m which would accomplish the same thing if the modem is always on before you start zterm and if other programs don t modify the settings or at z d m would work even if other programs modify the modem s settings i do it the way i do because i sometimes forget to turn on the modem before launching zterm and this way i m assured of having the correct dtr handling when the modem s powered up after comparing the above strings with my at commands reference guide i came up with atz l n x d s m this is entered in the initialize box on the modem preferences in zterm quick summary of each commmand z reset modem to user profile l speaker volume at fairly quiet n ring volume at fairly quiet x display connect info according to setting see manual d assume dtr computer is always on s dial speed at as fast as zyxel can handle in firstclass i used this same string with the addition of s right before the s command in the setup box this disables the auto answer function of the modem for firstclass i based my modem setting on the supra fax and just changed the above mentioned string in telefinder i based my setting on the zoom v hh setting i changed the modem initialization string to the same one i used for firstclass and everything seems to work fine sorry it took so long to get this summary out if someone wants to forward this to the info mac reports directory at sumex aim it

adn the computer is used in its designed purpose comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things i mean how can you say a is faster than a without giving is operational conditions can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions knowing that does not have transidental functions building in to its fpu and does can you say that is still faster anyway i hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor or how fast a processor is based on its name because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up but if we restrict our arguements to for example pure processor architectural issues or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design then we can get somewhere with our discussions chung yang in a resent article in one of the macmags i think a mhz accelerator was

and a computer scientist is about meaning the engineer makes more than p s the is not just a joke scott for the most part this is a bunch of bunk i ve got a computer engineering degree yet i ve spent the last years writing software that people actually use moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect i received job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were year lower my advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them emt well here is my worth advice from a grad student i agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me the important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it in my five years of education in this field though brief compare to alot of people i had to think about this kind of question a lot did i make the right decision in going into electrical engineering as opposed to computer engineering or cs the more i go thru school the more i believe that this kind of question is irrelevant i have come to believe that choosing cs because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something everything is interwoven and inseparable cs ce and ee are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other my advice is don t limit yourself but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn that of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school i would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible beside i don t know why the school would make a student choose a major before her his sophamore year hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case you suffer a little more and go to grad school about the money don t look at the averages if you are good you are going to earn more money than anyone else if you are a superstar programmer you will earn millions like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers chung yangquadra memory

left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a phillips head screw is at the base remove it taking care not to drop it into the case a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly cm

crashes of the time there s nothing but the original system software on the machine the battery has plenty of life i think this must be a power manager problem but i don t know what to do about it also the speaker occasionally makes a high pitched hiss the noise is irregular but seems to favor sleep and restart commands i ve had my duo for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems i reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems thinking they were system software problems initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore occasionally when i try to wake up the duo i get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen it freezes i also get the high pitched hiss occasionally but only at startup i ve called the apple

startup unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that pram is being corrupted by something system software bug i don t have any non issue inits in my system apparently the power manager can be reset by holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up apple s advice but since the duo does not have an interrupt button i m not sure what they mean in this case this may also help if someone can decipher apple s advice for me beyond this apple suggest that you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this duo since so many others appear to be having the same

mit edu david joshua mirsky writes hi i own an lciii and i recently heard an interesting rumor i heard that the lciii has a built in slot for a powerpc chip is this true i heard that the slot is not the same as the pds slot is that true thanks david mirsky mirsky gnu ai mit edu well i also have an lc iii popping the top revealed one socket for an additional vram simm one socket for a pin ram simm one socket for a flat pack fpu a processor direct slot pds identical to the lc lc ii but with an additional set of connetions to one side for the full bit data path that the lc lc ii lacked that s it i guess a board with a powerpc chip could be made that would fit in the pds but that s the only place so will it be possible to have a nubus or pds powerpc upgrade or will it require a logic board swap it would be interesting for apple to come out with a nubus powerpc that allowed use of the cpu s x like rocketshare but i guess that s getting a bit fantastic i was wondering since macweek reported that developers were seeded with powerpcs on a nubus card also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed last i heard the estimates were around times the speed of a quadra in native risc mode i heard an apple employee mumble something about the arrival of powerpc machines at a much earlier date that q but i doubt it s true finally is the powerpc developer s cd mini course available i saw it advertised in the developer s university calendar and i d like to know if it s at all interesting sean seanmcd ac dal ca radius speculated publicly that they could provide a powerpc based rocket for existing macs it would have the plus of rocketshare and the minus of nubus accelerators no true boot off the accelerator nubus bottleneck to video and other i o apple it seems will not compete with third parties here except perhaps for not yet available macs like cyclone where a powerpc slot might be advertised look for daystar and such to make powerpc accelerators one potential problem with any accelerator though is that it will need a rom companion and apple has licensed only radius with rocketshare to use any of its proprietary code apple is between the lines trying to let us know that powerpc macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of risc and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing macs perhaps then we ll see groundbreaking prices in mac logic board upgrades much the same way we ve seen much cheaper high performance cpus this year first generation powerpcs s will also hopefully have socketed cpus so that they ll be chip upgradeable to s a year later this should be possible in much the same way that s can be pulled for clock doublers if there is too much technical baggage which i doubt since the external busses are the same size width to do this perhaps we can have cpu daughterboard a la powerbook as standard to facilitate better cpu upgrades this is an area where apple has fallen far behing the intel based world perhaps catchup is in order by the way last week s pc week had an excellent story on powerpc pentium mips r dec alpha the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future worth reading for technojunkies also the latest pc has a cover story on pentium read it and all the other stories about how intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now once anyone is this

for the portable there are several vendors that still make ram for the portable there are two options some vendors sell memory that plugs into the ram slot inside the portable others sell memory that

university bookstore writes bunt student tc umn edu monthian buntan writes does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c regarding fpu in all mac price lists i ve seen every c has the message fpu optional i know from what we ve discussed in this newsgroup that all c have the fpu built in except the configuration why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn t have an fpu it does seem to be an option even though it really isn t i m planning to buy the c cd pretty soon but i m now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not well then allow me to end your confusion the c only come with an lc in the base configuration if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu why say optional if it s built in good question i have been wondering that since feb th if you get the centris with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a rc processor that has built in math coprocessor support my understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu this is possible but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option apple does not offer an upgrade from the non fpu system to become an fpu system and it is unclear whether the processor on the non fpu system a lc can be replaced with a rc supplied by another vendor this is not unclear at all in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lc s code to recognize the presence of the full s fpu and use it thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips you pop the lc out and pop in a full apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris which only comes with a non fpu lc processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apple s memo they did i think i would double check this it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc and the full are pin compatible and that the c can be upgraded to a full hadesre centris math coprocessor option david anthony guevara cup portal com writes sorry if this is a faq i don t normally read comp sys mac hardware i am purchasing a couple of centris s i configured the systems as follows eight mb ram ethernet mb vram math coprocessor option my purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the apple summary documentation to prove it i ordered the coprocessor option but i m really not sure that we needed it i thought the chip had a math coprocessor built into it has apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the chip in the centris i am concerned that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck apple has really confused people with this whole thing i think we ll be answering this question for about the next year or so there is no option to get an fpu on a c what you have is a choice of cpus there is the lc that does not have an integrated fpu like the full and is only present in the base model of the c appleusa and there is the full which you get when you order anything other than the base configuration therefore since you have ordered one of the mb versions with on board ethernet models you will not be getting the lc but even if you wanted to have the lc you wouldn t be able to order a c with mb ram on board ethernet and an lc it s not an option also a note to people out there that have c s and c s thinking that there is an optional fpu the class chip cannot recognize an external fpu so there is no socket on the motherboard for a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchase an fpu on a pds card or something like that the only way to get an fpu in these machines is to replace the lc with a full and if you have a c you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the lc with the full but if you have a c you do need to have a heat sink hadesre tcp ip routing localtalk ethernet in article qpn uinnjs stimpy css

a marketing plan for it technical issues are not terribly important at this point well my group s plan is to market a full page monitor for laptop computers it would be a third party product to be installed by authorized repair centers like newer technology s palettebook screen the idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen remember technical issues aside in fact by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration you could have regular or full height the screen would probably be monochrome the motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document because of the target users and applications color screens aren t really a neccessity we could hopefully keep the cost between and now please don t write this off as completely ridiculous i really need some constructive feedback so if you would please reply to me via email and let me know if you would consider buying a full page laptop screen how much you would be willing to pay for it any helpful commentaries on the idea also if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it doubtful but who knows please send me some thanks in advance mikebuilt in video

appreciated when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system the following types of sounds mono as far as i can tell all play fine through both speakers system beeps already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record armor alley spectre spaceward ho but the following games only play out of the left channel lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider oids but still stereo system beeps do play in stereo through both speakers the one i m specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates he can t run ootw because he doesn t have color we re both running system does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook or greater centris se etc stereo machine i used to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine not just on the left channel i could be mistaken though if there were a problem with the quad s and pb s i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo if there isn t a problem with our machines i wonder why the games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers like spectre etc do quadra s and powerbook s have the same roms to my knowledge so maybe this is a rom problem if so though why wouldn t system patch over this problem thanks for any help you can provide in article apr kth se jon wtte d jwa hemul nada kth se writes mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and mix the output the se for instance while others play in stereo but only has the left channel for the speaker while some are truly mono like the lc developers know that stuff played in the left channel is guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isn t some send data to both some only send data to the left channel the first is preferrable of course okay i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound the original documentation for the sound hardware im documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware basically you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbase x this was because of how the mac and some later machines generated sound was by scanning this block and d aing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines when the mac ii and apple sound chip was invented it was designed to generate stereo sound it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games furthermore people who port from the ibm don t want to learn more apis so it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound since it is very easy since the mac ii apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers on some macs quadra at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons if developers use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one does if developers write to sound base their games will only come out the left on some games the other problem the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se mixes both isn t really related it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines it only affects true stereo sounds sounds which are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have now to more directly address the question the games you list lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider oids and also hellcats super tetris oxyd and many more these are just what i ve tested cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras other games you list armor alley spectre spaceward ho and also pga tour golf civilization and more these are again only from personal experience use the sound manager and work fine on all machines the more of the story is to developers don t cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but i m going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it in conclusion to doug it isn t a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it isn t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels if they do it the right way it is taken care of automatically if you cheat there is not way to make it work on all hardware have fun disclaimer number i don t work on sound here at apple i m just pretty well informed so don t write me with sound questions disclaimer number if it says up above that i

com dashley wyvern wyvern com doug ashley writes seanmcd ac dal ca writes in article wgwc pdl y netcom com wgw netcom com william g wright writes anyway i was hoping someone knowledgeable about mac internals could set me straight is it simply impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could to use the grayscale features i believe you need a mac equipped with colour quickdraw i was told this somewhere or other but it s i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscale images loaded with the proper software however the mac se cannot display grayscale on the original poster w g wright posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz bang laser printer from apple a select i think which can print grayscale he then said that he cannot print grayscale from his se computer and also that all the experts he has dealt with agree that it is not possible this is the one major bugbear about doing a rd party se upgrade compared to apple s se to se upgrade you will never be able to run color quickdraw it is color quickdraw that controls color and grayscale ses can print some colour this is because quickdraw the original non colour version has the right hooks for eight colours some of you will remember the scsigraph solution to getting a colour screen for your se i think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something there is no reason that apple couldn t release software patches for older computers there are lots of mac pluses classics and ses that have been upgraded to and processors which should be perfectly able to deal with color quickdraw but they wont and rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the mac s roms i e nutek et al just one caveat i would have thought that if you were printing a postscript grayscale image onto a postscript grayscale printer that you would be able to do so whatever mac you were using and i am pretty sure that the select is not a postscript printer correct me if i m wrong phil ryan melbourne

with the quadra line the centris line pales in comparison does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the disparity in graphics processor performance i think you are suffering from some alignment or color table or whatever problems if a color classic is as fast as a quadra rendering to screen what screen card you use does of course matter much built in video is almost

the display is yea it looks great in the store but is that all wow or is it really that good could i solicit some opinions of people who use the and day to day on if its worth taking the disk size and

problems between my q and my venerable jasmine megadrive cartridge drives my solution was to get silverlining none of the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives in fact the only loop

to make the whole thing worth more than my whole computer the tech support guys at ocean microsystems suggested that some third party drivers might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn t format mount partition for a ux all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my mac plus and my powerbook it was for this reason i assumed the problem had something to do with the quadra even with the quadra they mostly worked ok the problem occurred when i ejected a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes saying this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware even though there was no cartridge in the drive mark i have been using the pli sony mo drive and now a sharp color scanner using standard scsi cables and standard terminator on my q no problems if you were using a iifx that might be another story make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end some boxes have internal terminators some can be switched out and others are socketted these count if the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling they have to be disabled ie switched out or pulled out of their sockets if you have boxes with internal terminations the terminations in one box has to be disabled etc i am sure that this has been covered by the experts my experience with scsi boxes that connect to the

program interaction up to the os and video hardware in question faisal nameer jawdat in addition ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present matt healy nor a standardized screen drawing toolbox like mac s qd as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly at present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program os print driver and monitor card that editing bit pictures regardless of color mode os and

color graphics array subset of vga that provides all the features of mda cga but lacks some ega and vga modes like vga x x dictionary of computer terms dct common on the initial ps implementation from ibm and some ps models svga super vga this is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a catch all category for a group of video cards as such with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme svga was chaos with people debating as to what is svga and what is not in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units but things are still a mess video is either k or m today resolution of x and x at and colors are common newer ones since have the sierra hicolor ramdac giving bit colors at x some of the very newer ones can do bits per pixel usually at x speedwise too much variation some very slow western digital paradise based for example some very fast s c based for example some are so so like tseng et a very popular chipset some limiting factors overcome by mhz vl bus s linear address mapping were mhz isa bus at architecture where the cpu looks at the card through a k window etc other non svga standards a ibm s own standard interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw polygon fill etc in hardware some clone implementations from ati are the fastest video available today though some clone models do not have interlacing tms high end graphics co processors usually some do bit speeds up vector oriented graphics like cad xga extended graphics array newer and faster than a only available for mca bus based ps s clones are coming out soon emulates vga ega and cga dct max resolution at x x b same as a also some bpp modes xga accelerates graphics functions up to times faster than standard vga in windows and os including line draws bit and pixel block transfers area fills masking and x y addressing has an intelligent way to detect and co exist with other xga cards so multiple desktops like on the mac may not be far away since this is an architecture its resolution and color depth isn t fixed ibm implements only bit color while other companies can have bit color

section above for specific details expansion both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus only some monitors and cd rom main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the end any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm scsi devices per scsi controller bit asynchronous mb s ave and synchronous mb s max transfers difference is due to scsi software drivers fast scsi is a misname for bit scsi in scsi mode see scsi for details scsi devices per scsi controller in scsi mode scsi is fully scsi compliant and bit scsi tends to be implemented as a very fast scsi since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that and bit scsi do transfer speeds are mb s with mb s burst bit mb s with mb s burst bit and mb s with mb s burst bit wide and fast since bit scsi can use scsi software drivers and hardware at bit scsi speeds and as such is limited to devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast scsi bit fast scsi requires a scsi software driver and scsi electronics but can still use the scsi ports wide bit and bit scsi require a different scsi port electronics and software driver from scsi which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces mac scsi asynchronous scsi built in standard since the plus even though apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers the os scsi manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi interfaces as a result present scsi macs use bit scsi as a fast asynchronous scsi presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi controller chip built in digital review oct v n p though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide scsi port interface since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi older nubus macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu rumor some cyclone macs june will come with a wide fast scsi port standard and have a rewritten os scsi manager ibm scsi scsi is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with systems except as add on eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable like the mac bit scsi is used as a very fast scsi by most controllers out there unlike the mac ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for scsi mac memory expansion with a few exceptions the mac has used non parity pin bit simm memory expansion since the plus while pin bit parity simms could be used in these macs only special iicis could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm types are called pin simms the iifx used pin parity simms the lc iii c and q all use a new pin simm that is accessable by bits at a time and is used in ibms the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing reading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is since macs made before feb managed memory baced on data path simms had to be installed in pairs bit or in sets of bit the centris and quadra eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time if the simms are the same size are used then the memory is interleaved across the two simms resulting in a performance boost on ram access macworld apr

data and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the os since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram in addition what little rom code there is also read into ram a process called shadow rom this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or eproms having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a rom based system due to the patches needed in addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed side note the ftc charged that microsoft formed a os trust by not providing all feature documentation for its oses to developers outside

trying to use kermit i was building a serial connection between my duo and my next i think the problem was in the handshaking basically you need to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides a safe place to start is by selecting no handshaking on either end one problem is that the zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it wrong and only a reset will clear it i don t know the specifics but this could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system it could very well be that you are doing things right eventually but one wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further correct actions until the next machine reset i have wedged my mac and also my next that way now i can send files back and forth

timing irregularities deviating from the standard scsi specification this results in silent corruption of data when used with some devices including ultra modern devices although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an example would be a sony inch mo without the special mac compatible firmware installed one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes to the best of my knowledge there aren t any problems with quadras and blind transfers trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the tibs or didn t test their driver with the device in question well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of sec occur this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks if this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn t pay attention to the errors coming back note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the scsi bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the scsi manager the problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the scsi chip when the next byte hasn t been clocked yet also note that the bus error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn t crash the machine clinton bauder apple computerre simm vs dram arthur greene p f n z fidonet org

apple com writes enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games the sound driver is pretty ok since it s fast sound manager used by the book is useless disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation it s too slow the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately system supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally the more of the story is to developers don t cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but i m going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it well i want my code to work on old systems too i don t know about sys but at least on there are bugs in the sound manager that causes channels to hang with no error message this happends when i keep a channel open for long periods necessary for performance and play many sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems not to be reliable then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel qhead i think it was and the only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it am i happy with this nope i consider writing to soundbase simply to get rid of the bugs any better
