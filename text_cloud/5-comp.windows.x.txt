help people who wish to submit entries to x the international obfuscated c code contest ioccc for short x x this is not the ioccc rules though it does contain comments about x them the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x allowed even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x xwhat is new in x x the entry format is better for us anyway the program mkentry c x has been updated see entry format x x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with x non integral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year x might be old the next year x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignoring include lines x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the x byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly x working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x x define d define x d foo don t expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j don t use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c such as k r c you must avoid areas that result in x compile link errors for ansi c compilers x x unfortunately ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type x thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed x x int i x char c x i c use c i instead x i string use string i instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments be careful systems implement va list as a wide variety x of ways because of this a number of operations using va list are x not portable and must not be used x x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg x performing arithmetic on va list variables x using va list as a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va list variables as if they were a char s x x avoid using varargs h use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x must not assume that it returns an int x x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x programs that are compact and are instructional x x one line programs should be short one line programs say around x bytes long getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or un x version specific x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers x x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use bytes of d s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend x on color or a given size don t require backing store x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not x everyone has x r and some people are stuck back in x r or x earlier so try to target x r without requiring x r better x yet try to make your entry run on all version x window systems x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x in the remark section x x we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh and or throw up x x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x areas really does help x x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging process x x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry c x x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x where this program differs from the contest rules the x contest rules will be used be sure to check with the x contest rules before submitting an entry x x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules x x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x x the following is a sample entry x x entry xrule xfix n xtitle chonglab xentry xdate mon mar xhost un x v pdp x bsd pdp x remark x this is a non obfuscated obfuscated c program x x it is likely not to win a prize but what do you expect from x a short example x

xaddr toad hall x po box x san francisco california x x usa xemail hoptoad sun lab x lab sun com xanon n x info x xend x build xbegin build x v o ryc uo r v x xend x program xend x end x x typically the build file should assume that the source is prog c x and will compile into prog if an entry wins we will rename x its source and binary to avoid filename collision by tradition x we use the name of the entry s title followed by an optional x digit in case of name conflicts x x if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x we would use chonglab c and chonglab x x if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x and or binary files be a particular name please say so in the x remark section if this case applies it would be be helpful x if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filename s in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files for example x x cc prog c o special name need special binary x x or rm f special src c need special source x cp prog c special src c x cc special src c o special name x x or rm f special build need special build x tail build special build x sh special build x x assume that we will use the entry title send us a version of x your build program files that uses the name convention you x should uuencode these files in data sections x x if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x please say so in the remark section you should try to avoid x touching your original build source and binary files you should x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify this x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch x x remember that your entry may be built without a build file we x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile if the x build file must exist say so in the remark section x x if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x into info sections in the case of multiple info files x use multiple info sections if no info files are needed x then skip the info section x x info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x does not fit well into the remark section for example an x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x programs for the user to compile an entry might want to include a x lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x hints file x x info files should be used only to supplement your entry for x example info files may provide sample input or detailed x information about your entry because they are supplemental x the entry should not require them exist x x in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x conflicts if info files should not be renamed for some reason x say so in the remark section x x info files must uudecode into the current directory if they x absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub directory say x so in the remark section x x when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x a unique entry number from to your first entry should x have entry number x x with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x format may be ignored that is don t place text outside of the x entry and expect the judges to see it our decoding tools aren t x ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x remark section or send a email to the judges at x x apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for x judges toad com submitting entries x x the date should be given with respect to utc some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime in the c locale an example of such a string is x x thr apr x x this format is similar to the output of the date command the x string does not include the timezone name before the year on many x systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x x date u a h d t y x date u sed e s x sh c tz utc date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x x you are allowed to update fix revise your entry to do so set x the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced x x xjudging process x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x entries are unpacked into individual directories the email message x is unpacked into individual files each containing x x entry section x all author sections x all info sections x build section x program section x any other text including the email message headers x x prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly information from the x author sections are not read until the judging process is x complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular x individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given we like the surprise of finding x out in the end who won and where they were from x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winning x files and shred all related paper by tradition we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks x x after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos we x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds during a round x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round thus an entry gets at least two readings x x a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info section s if any x passing the source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x x in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compiling building the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about entries entries x are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because it x does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x when the number of entries thins to about entries we begin to form x award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards x an entry often will compete in several categories x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangest most creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups x x comp lang c comp unix wizards alt sources x x in addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following x x comp sources d alt sources d misc misc x comp sources misc comp windows x x x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives see x below for details x x often winning entries are published in selected magazines winners x have appeared in books the new hackers dictionary and on t shirts x x last but not least winners receive international fame and flames x x xfor more information x x you may contact the judges by sending email to the following

above ii what is xfree and where do i get it what is xfree xfree is an enhanced version of x which was distributed with x r this release consists of many bug fixes speed improvements and other enhancements here are the highlights of the enhancements the speedup package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfree selectable at run time via the xconfig file some speedups require an et based svga and others require a virtual screen width of the speedups suitable to the configuration are selected by default with a high quality et board vram this can yield up to improvement of the xstones benchmark over x the fx packages from jim tsillas are included as the default operating mode if speedup is not selected this mode is now equivalent in performance to x b x r and approximately faster than x support for localconn compile time selectable for server clients or both this support is for both svr and svr for svr with the advanced compatibility package local connections from sco xsight odt clients are supported drivers for ati and trident tvga c and tvga svga chipsets refer to the files readme ati and readme trident for details about the ati and trident drivers support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added thomas eberhardt s code from the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu type font code from mit contrib tape has been included and is compile time selectable there are contributed type fonts in the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu new configuration method which allows the server s drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions integrated support for bsd mach and linux a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga cards is now included the following key features were added with the release of xfree they were not in xfree the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank switching of available svga memory to allow virtual screens up to x see the x manual page for more information support for the hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server and with it the ability to support a two headed server one vga and one hercules so far this has only been tested on svr it is also reported to work under linux svr shared libraries tested under isc svr and support for svr there are some special considerations to consider due to new usl bugs see the readme svr file for more information support for ps mice and logitech mouseman trackman some versions of these devices were not previously compatible a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data written by eric raymond derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation greatly improved support for international keyboards including implementation of the compose key functionality found on many vendor servers see the x keybd manual page for more information the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has been improved and the timings are now stored at accuracies of mhz users may want to consider removing an existing clocks line from their xconfig file and re probing using the new server many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig configuration file error messages are much more informative and intuitive and more validation is done there are many new options that can be enabled in the xconfig file see the x manual page for more information on the format of this file plus a number of other small things refer to the changelog file in the source distribution for full details also included are a tutorial

tseng et tseng et paradise pvga western digital wd c wd c wd c these are supersets of the pvga and use its driver genoa gvga trident tvga c tvga ati all of the above are supported in both color and monochrome modes with the exception of the ati chipsets which are only supported in color mode the monochrome server also supports generic vga cards using k of video memory in a single bank and the hercules card on the et only k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server and the gvga has not been tested with more than k it appears that some of the svga card manufacturers are going to non traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel clock frequencies to avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes xfree adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered refer to the readme clkprog file for information on how these programs work if you need to write one if you do develop such a program the xfree team would be interested in including it with future xfree releases if you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using xfree it is suggested that you purchase an et based board such as the orchid prodesigner iis avoid recent diamond boards xfree will not work with them because diamond won t provide programming details in fact the xfree project is actively not supporting new diamond products as long as such policies remain in effect contributions of code will not be accepted because of the potential liabilities if you would like to see this change tell diamond about it some people have asked if xfree would work with local bus or eisa video cards theoretically the means of communication between the cpu and the video card is irrelevant to xfree compatibility it could be isa eisa or local bus what should matter is the chipset on the video card unfortunately the developers don t have a lot of access to eisa or vlb machines so this is largely an untested theory however we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of xfree working fine on them what about accelerated boards at this time there is no support in xfree for accelerated boards like the s ati ultra a tiga etc this support is available in commercial products from sgcs and metrolink for svr and svr an s server is available for bsd and linux contact hasty netcom com for bsd or jon robots ox ac uk for linux a beta a server is available for linux contact martin cs unc edu or jon robots ox ac uk note these servers are not part of xfree why doesn t xfree support color vga modes the reason that this is not supported is the way vga implements the color modes in color modes each byte of frame buffer memory contains pixel but the color modes are implemented as bit planes each byte of frame buffer memory contains bit from each of each of pixels and there are four such planes the mit frame buffer code is not designed to deal with this if vga handled color modes by packing bit pixels into each byte the mit code could be modified to support this or it already may i m not sure but for the vga way of doing things a complete new frame buffer implementation is required some beta testers are looking into this but nothing is yet available from the project what other hardware or software requirements are there obviously a supported svga board and os are required to run x efficiently mb of memory should be considered a minimum the various binary releases take mb of disk space depending on the os e g whether or not it supports shared libraries to build from sources at least mb of free disk space will be required although mb should be considered a comfortable lower bound where can i get source for

when building the distribution iv what general things should i know about running xfree installation directories the top level installation directory is specified by the projectroot usr x by default variable in config site def binaries include files and libraries are installed in projectroot bin include lib this can be changed when rebuilding from sources and can be modified via symbolic links for those oss that support them this directory is nonstandard and was chosen this way to allow xfree to be installed alongside a commercial vendor supplied x implementation configuration files the xfree server reads a configuration file xconfig on startup the search path contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage which should be consulted before asking questions determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes david e wexelblat dwex mtgzfs att com maintains a database of known clock settings for vga cards and monitor settings the database is installed in usr x lib x etc modedb txt and is in the source tree under mit server ddx x etc this database is also available from him for the latest copy and is kept on export lcs mit edu in contrib x modedb z which is updated occasionally obtain a copy of this database it just might have the settings you need if you create new settings please send them to david for inclusion in the database if this doesn t help you the videomodes doc by eric raymond file with xfree contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings it may be helpful to start with settings that almost work and use this description to get them right when you do send the information to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database note the old clock exe program is not supported any more and is completely unnecessary if you need to determine dot clock values for a new board remove the clocks line from your xconfig file if present and start the server the server will probe for clocks itself and print them out you can use these values to put a clocks line into your xconfig file which is not necessary but will speed up starting the server in the future rebuilding reconfiguring the server from the link kit if you have installed the server binary link kit it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server this is fully explained in the readme file that is available with the link kit v what os

look at ftp readme mach vi what things should i know for building xfree from source this section has been removed from the faq since it is fully explained in ftp readme and the os specific readmes please look at those files for information on building xfree vii is there anything special about building clients with xfree bsd compatibility library a lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy etc the default configuration files are set up to link with libxbsd a which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random seed a better way of providing the b functions is to include x xfuncs h in source files that call them xfuncs h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the sysv mem functions if you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions then you should link with libxbsd a ansiccoptions this is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ansi ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to rewrite the entire ccoptions line for example with stock mit you d see something like ccoptions ansi o fwritable strings and to get rid of the ansi ness the developer would have to put ccoptions o fwritable strings in his imakefile with this change you would see a default of ansiccoptions ansi ccoptions o fwritable strings and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is ansiccoptions to get rid of the ansi ness many x clients will die a horrible death with ansi the effect is even more dramatic in practice because ccoptions is actually quite complex the other issue is that one must add

c code to allow useful graphical components to be created included with this are classes that provide the base functionality object rectobj core composite constraint shell overrideshell wmshell etc the terms xt and intrinsics are used interchangeably however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the x window system in particular it does not include the athena motif olit or any other widget set without further widgets the intrinsics are not especially useful o a widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via xt the precise use is any object that is a subclass of the core class it is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets o xlib is the c interface to the x protocol it is one layer below the xt intrinsics typically a widget uses relatively few xlib functions because xt provides most such services although an understanding of xlib helps with

windows x intrinsics it is on export in contrib faq xt why does my application core dump when i use signals alarms cthreads in brief xlib xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler this flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback it is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler as another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes this effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using xtappaddinput and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal however this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up why don t the intrinsics deal with this problem primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system is that a good enough reason i don t think so note the article in the x journal and the example in o reilly volume are in error how do i use a different visual than the default this requires a more complicated answer than it should a window has three things that are visual specific the visual colormap and border pixmap all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap resource only shell widgets have visual resources another questions deals with why shells have a visual the default value of these resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says in the shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen when any one of the three resources is not properly set a badmatch error occurs when the window is created they are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used how to get this to work there are two parts to the answer the first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual the second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available the first is a little harder because you ll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information some sample code to start up an application using something other than the default visual to compile

appropriate visual it has to be specified by the user if you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension or some such why no application runs in isolation depending on the way a server allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications i may be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor or just monochrome as an example on a low end color sun server there are many different possible visuals monochrome entry colormap static gray static color and a truecolor the sgi iris s offer all the above plus bit truecolor bit truecolor an overlay plane why do only shell widgets have a visual this is strictly by convention it makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell a widget can have its own visual resource if it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls xcreatewindow you should also make this a resource that can be obtained with xtgetvalues so other widgets can find it a reasonable value is probably xtnvisual which visual depth and colormap do shells inherit the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent this is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen defaultdepthofscreen and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent i e it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree if the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the visual i ve done all the above and i still get a badmatch error why some resource converters improperly cache references this was especially true of x r and earlier versions of motif why doesn t my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget see section of the xt specification it eventually does get destroyed just not immediately the intrinsics destroy a widget in a two phase process first it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed this way any pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed the second phase is then performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have completed before checking for the next x event at this point the list is traversed and each widget s memory is actually free d among other things as some further caveats trivia the widgets may be destroyed if the intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list if so then the phase destruction occurs immediately also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used such as calling exit directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state such as open sockets temporary files allocated x resources etc this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget widget toplevelget gw widget gw widget to find toplevel widget top for top gw xtparent top top xtparent top empty return top void exitcallback gw closure call data widget gw widget xtpointer closure data the app specified xtpointer call data widget specific data widget toplevel toplevel toplevelget gw xtunmapwidget toplevel make it disappear quickly xtdestroywidget toplevel exit one can see that the above code exit s immediately after destroying the toplevel widget the trouble is the phase destruction may never occur this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state you might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the destroy callbacks one alternative is to modify exitcallback to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop however private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain practices try the following code instead include x intrinsic h extern widget toplevelget if needfunctionprototypes widget gw endif extern boolean exitworkproc if needfunctionprototypes xtpointer closure endif extern void exitcallback if needfunctionprototypes widget gw xtpointer closure xtpointer call data endif widget toplevelget gw

gw exitworkproc xtpointer null boolean exitworkproc closure xtpointer closure exit notreached exitcallback adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed how do i resize a shell widget after it is realized one doesn t resize a shell widget the proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the shell widget using xtsetvalues the geometry change is then propagated to the shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request however the shell must have the resource xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize to change the position of a shell use xtsetvalues on the shell not the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted why can t xtappaddinput handle files it does however unix semantics for when i o is ready for a file does not fit most peoples intuitive model in unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read call would not block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block this works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes for a file the read will always return but the return indicates an eof i e no more data the result is the code in the intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read the culprit is the select system call or on sysv based os s it is the poll system call how to get around this on a unix system the best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput a suitable program on bsd systems is tail f filename it s rumored that select on some systems is not completely reliable in particular ibm aix this is one where it would work for a while several thousand times and then stop until some other event woke it up this seemed to be the result of a race condition in the kernel ibm claims to have a fix for this pyramid doesn t work at all ultrix and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets wasn t completely broken but although the writing side wrote in byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks get raound it by detecting the situation and having select ignore the pipe for mseconds by then it had been given the whole block note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as read file descriptor pipes etc this is an os dependent area and may not be identical on all systems however the intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit why they didn t also deal with signals at this point i don t know what good books and magazines are there on xt i have a favorite that is the definitive reference to my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the intrinsics when i started

c stanford tcl tk c sprite berkeley edu however much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop in the next years that uses an object oriented language keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than c starts gaining acceptance how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues first what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is essentially typdef struct string name long value arg and the code arg arg xtsetarg arg name expands to arg arg arg name name arg value you can see that with normal c type conversions the arg value gets the integer instead of the floating point value when the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value so how to get around this the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am now recomending it over the previous suggestions define xtsetfloatarg arg n d if sizeof float sizeof xtargval xtsetarg arg n d else xtargval ld xtargval d xtsetarg arg n ld how do i write a resource converter courtesy of rich thomson rthomson dsd es com the following discussion of resource converters assumes r or r intrinsics resource converters changed between r and r to allow for destructors and caching of converted values there are several main types of resource converters string to data type data type to string data type to data type i string to data type usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values this is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values name value true false in this case the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings this is most readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the resource manager the resource value is turned into a quark which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values if there are many enumerated strings in the converter or many converters each with a small number of enumeration strings then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks that way the first time one of these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters ii data type to string this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isn t necessary instead the data type value is simply converted to a string value probably by the use of sprintf data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file this mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state into a file this snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter it isn t much extra effort to write the data type to string converter writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent iii data type to data type this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type for instance an x pixel value can be converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for red green and blue the type signature for a resource converter is as follows typedef boolean xttypeconverter display xrmvalueptr cardinal xrmvalueptr xrmvalueptr xtpointer display dpy xrmvalueptr args cardinal num args xrmvalueptr fromval xrmvalueptr toval xtpointer converter data when the converter is invoked the fromval argument points to the source x resource manager value and the toval argument points to the destination x resource manager value the converter data argument is an opaque pointer to some converter specific data that is specified when the converter is registered the args and num args arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked for instance the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel care must be taken with the toval argument an xrmvalue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value typedef struct unsigned int size caddr t addr xrmvalue xrmvalueptr when the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be null in the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value if the destination area is not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return false the caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter if the size is large enough then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return true if the location is null then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return true when writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro define done var type if toval addr if toval size sizeof type toval size sizeof type return false else type toval addr var else toval addr caddr t var toval size sizeof type return true define donestr str if toval addr toval size sizeof string toval size sizeof string return false else toval addr caddr t str toval size sizeof string return true inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the num args and args arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly once you have written your converter you need to register it with the intrinsics the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database to register a converter with a single application context use xtappsettypeconverter void xtappsettypeconverter context from to converter args num args cache destructor xtappcontext context string from string to xttypeconverter converter xtconvertarglist args cardinal num args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor to register a converter with all application contexts use xtsettypeconverter void xtsettypeconverter from to converter args num args cache destructor string from string to xttypeconverter converter xtconvertarglist args cardinal num args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor in the r intrinsics there were the routines xtappaddconverter and xtaddconverter these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter and xtsettypeconverter whenever possible the newer routines should be used when a converter is registered with the intrinsics a cache argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached xtcachenone don t cache any converted values xtcacheall cache all converted values xtcachebydisplay cache converted values on a per display basis caching converted values that require a round trip to the server is a good idea for instance string to pixel conversions the destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed xtdestructor has the following type definition typedef void xtdestructor xtappcontext xrmvalueptr xtpointer xrmvalueptr cardinal xtappcontext context xrmvalueptr to xtpointer converter data xrmvalueptr args cardinal num args the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the to argument itself to addr the destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed for instance colormap and visual arguments for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated pixel from the colormap as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit r distribution mit lib xt converters c contrib lib pext converters c contrib lib pext converters h how do i open multiple displays see multi user application software using xt the x resource issue summer by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved most of this answer is based on that article in a nutshell one uses xtopendisplay to add each display to a single application context and then xtclosedisplay to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context the real problems occur when trying to close down a display this can happen ways user selects a quit button on one of the displays user has window manager send a wm delete window message server disconnect possibly from a killclient message server shutdown crash or network failure i ll assume you can deal gracefully with since it is merely a problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that display if not then read the oliver jones article the third one is difficult to handle the following is based on the oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult problem the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an i o error is always unrecoverable and so fatal this is essentially true for a single display x based application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an x server when an x i o error occurs the i o error handler is called and if it returns then an exit happens the only way around this is to use setjmp longjmp to avoid returning to the i o error handler the following code fragment demonstrates this include setjmp h jmp buf xiorecover void xiohandler dpy display dpy destroydisplay dpy longjmp xiorecover main if setjmp xiorecover xsetioerrorhandler xiohandler xtappmainloop app context the destroydisplay is something that given a display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup it should also call xtclosedisplay for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp longjmp when setjmp is first called it returns a and save s enough information in the jmp buf that a latter execution of longjmp can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp was just executed the return value of this second setjmp is the value of the second argument to longjmp there are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources the most likely symptoms are xlib errors such as badcolor badatom or badfont there may be problems with the total numbre teleuse uim x and c in article apr

xlib operations work and some do not in particular the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some xdrawpoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is clicked on and moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area this also happens less consistently when the pulldown popup is moved in the leftward direction assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug thanks zack t smithx for pc i have heard of two packages for the

encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year x might be old the next year x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignoring include lines x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the x byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly x working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x x define d define x d foo don t expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j don t use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c such as k r c you must avoid areas that result in x compile link errors for ansi c compilers x x unfortunately some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of x integral type thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should x not be used in this rule may be relaxed in future contests x x int i x char c x i c use c i instead x i string use string i instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments be careful systems implement va list as a wide variety x of ways because of this a number of operations using va list are x not portable and must not be used x x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg x performing arithmetic on va list variables x using va list as a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va list variables as if they were a char s x x avoid using varargs h use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x must not assume that it returns an int x x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x programs that are compact and are instructional x x one line programs should be short one line programs say around x bytes long getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or un x version specific x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers x x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use bytes of d s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend x on color or a given size don t require backing store x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not x everyone has x r and some people are stuck back in x r or x earlier so try to target x r without requiring x r better x yet try to make your entry run on all version x window systems x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x in the remark section x x we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh and or throw up x x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x areas really does help x x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging process x x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry c x x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x where this program differs from the contest rules the x contest rules will be used be sure to check with the x contest rules before submitting an entry x x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules x x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x x the following is a sample entry x x entry xrule xfix n xtitle chonglab xentry xdate mon mar xhost un x v pdp x bsd pdp x remark x this is a non obfuscated obfuscated c program x x it is likely not to win

file should assume that the source is prog c x and will compile into prog if an entry wins we will rename x its source and binary to avoid filename collision by tradition x we use the name of the entry s title followed by an optional x digit in case of name conflicts x x if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x we would use chonglab c and chonglab x x if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x and or binary files be a particular name please say so in the x remark section if this case applies it would be be helpful x if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filename s in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files for example x x cc prog c o special name need special binary x x or rm f special src c need special source x cp prog c special src c x cc special src c o special name x x or rm f special build need special build x tail build special build x sh special build x x assume that we will use the entry title send us a version of x your build program files that uses the name convention you x should uuencode these files in data sections x x if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x please say so in the remark section you should try to avoid x touching your original build source and binary files you should x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify this x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch x x remember that your entry may be built without a build file we x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile if the x build file must exist say so in the remark section x x if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x into info sections in the case of multiple info files x use multiple info sections if no info files are needed x then skip the info section x x info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x does not fit well into the remark section for example an x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x programs for the user to compile an entry might want to include a x lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x hints file x x info files should be used only to supplement your entry for x example info files may provide sample input or detailed x information about your entry because they are supplemental x the entry should not require them exist x x in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x conflicts if info files should not be renamed for some reason x say so in the remark section x x info files must uudecode into the current directory if they x absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub directory say x so in the remark section x x when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x a unique entry number from to your first entry should x have entry number x x with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x format may be ignored that is don t place text outside of the x entry and expect the judges to see it our decoding tools aren t x ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x remark section or send a email to the judges at x x apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for x judges toad com submitting entries x x the date should be given with respect to utc some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime in the c locale an example of such a string is x x thr apr x x this format is similar to the output of the date command the x string does not include the timezone name before the year on many x systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x x date u a h d t y x date u sed e s x sh c tz utc date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x x you are allowed to update fix revise your entry to do so set x the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced x x xjudging process x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x entries are unpacked into individual directories the email message x is unpacked into individual files each containing x x entry section x all author sections x all info sections x build section x program section x any other text including the email message headers x x prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly information from the x author sections are not read until the judging process is x complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular x individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given we like the surprise of finding x out in the end who won and where they were from x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winning x files and shred all related paper by tradition we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks x x after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos we x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds during a round x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round thus an entry gets at least two readings x x a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info section s if any x passing the source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x x in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compiling building the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about entries entries x are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because it x does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x when the number of entries thins to about entries we begin to form x award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards x an entry often will compete in several categories x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangest most creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the

events for gadgets they track for all events such as motion notify wether or not the gadget expresses interest in the events as a result gadgets typically generate a great deal more network traffic those with x terminals might find a noticable network performance drop as a result really what s the point using gadgets then it is a case of memory vs network performance tradeoff gadgets save both client and server memory but memory is easily expandable while network performance is not so if i were designing motif i would at least make it possible to avoid using gadgets at present you really don t have a choice because motif forces you to use gadgets in menus and in various other places adrian nye o reilly and associates inc i ve been using the xmgraph widget that s been floating around and i noticed the performance is significantly better using gadgets perhaps even faster i had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance and that it s just as well to use widgets everywhere so why would pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than pushbuttons in the graph should i start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus xmgraph manages

apr burns cogsci ed ac uk tkld cogsci ed ac uk kevin davidson writes in my opinion a programming degree is still worth having yes but a cs degree is not a programming degree does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught computer science is a branch of maths or the course i did was i ve also done a software engineering course much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach programming the ability to program was an entry requirement at robert gordon university programming was the main most time consuming start of the course the first two years consisted of five subjects software engineering pascal c unix computer engineering assembler computer theory lisp prolog mathematics statistics and communication skills how to pass interviews intelligence tests and group discussions e g how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea the third year industrial placement was spent working for a computer company for a year the company could be anywhere in europe there was a special travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors the fourth year included operating systems c modula software engineering c assembler real time laboratory c assembler and computing theory lisp there were also group projects in nd and th years where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly in the first four years there was a weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects however in the honours year this was reduced to a split between an individual project and final exams no coursework assessment are all computer science courses like this btw we started off with students in our first year and were left with by honours year also every course is tutored separately not easy trying to sleep when you are in student class cheers

to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation faults when running x note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the x or vax platforms here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when gcc compiled parts of x are linked with sun supplied functions that pass or return structs run time errors occur affected programs include rgb and the server this is from the gcc manual on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for structures it passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in gnu cc so it isn t straightforward to fix it the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and fpcc struct return does not help you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags files which need to be compiled using cc include server os bsd oscolor c rgb rgb c in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values clients xhost xhost c clients xauth gethost c calls to inet addr in lib clx socket c and lib x xconndis c are possibly harmless as they don t involve structs collected by bashford scripps edu don bashford subject what are these i o errors running x built with gcc when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error getting interface configuration operation not supported on socket fatal server bug no screens found running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn t work you can do this simple test include sys ioctl h siocgifconf run that through cc e and gcc e the last line of output is the piece of interest it should be identical modulo

a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the system specific

call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental authoritative documents i e the asente swick volume do say that the order is undefined because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application xt cannot guarantee the order of execution in general the callback procedures should be

an inconsistent state note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions you can work

subject how can my xt program handle socket pipe or file input it s very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or the other file descriptor a solution is use xtappaddinput after you open your file descriptor use xtappaddinput to register an input handler the input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program s attention write the input handler like you would any other xt callback so it does its work quickly and returns it is important to use only non blocking i o system calls in your input handlers most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file you will find that the function is called even when there isn t input pending xtappaddinput is actually working as it is supposed to the input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read not only when there is new data to be read a disk file unlike a pipe or socket is almost always ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you ve read before the result is that your function will almost always be called every time around xtappmainloop there is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data if ioctl fd fionread n n return but because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a busy wait you may be better off not using xtappaddinput and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input courtesy dan heller argv ora com mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu ollie jones oj pictel com subject how do i simulate a button press release

which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single x display supports a server can support several independent screens they are numbered unix unix unix etc the screen or screen number is the second digit the which can be thought of as an index into the array of available screens on this particular display connection the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular screen on which your application is running typically have two forms one which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screen number in xt based programs you typically use xtscreen widget to determine the screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the screen have display in the names xdisplaywidth xdisplayheight etc subject can i use c with x motif xview the x r header files are compatible with c the motif header

pixmap itself is destroyed if you re sure a window has a background pixel not a pixmap you can use xcleararea to clear a region to the background color and then use xgetimage to read back that pixel

order to create a window which is mostly transparent you have several choices the shape extension first released with x r offers an easy way to make non rectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent however not all servers support the extension a machine specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware note that there is no x notion of a transparent color index a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application

undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself on many x servers black and white often or programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break if you want to be combining colors with gxxor then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre computed values if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc graphics context to and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red say the result is

has the id of a window on a remote display i want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it because x is asynchronous there isn t a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it what you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to catch any badwindow errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists this scheme will work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its id reallocated to another window courtesy ken lee klee synoptics com subject can i have two applications draw to the same window yes the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources actually the server assigns some bits the client others and any application that knows the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource except for gcs and private color cells can be shared the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple applications a simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines is in the first application to create a specially named property on the root window and put the window id into it the second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the question about using window ids on remote displays note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher level cooperation among your applications note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same

the presence of a virtual desktop subject how do i keep a window from being resized by the user resizing the window is done through the window manager window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen you can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best subject how do i keep a window in the foreground at all times it s rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself e g by tracking visibilitynotify events so that it isn t overlapped imagine the conflict between two such programs running the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override redirect this means that you are temporarily assuming window management duties while the window is up so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time e g for popup menus or other short parameter setting windows thanks to der mouse mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu subject how do i make text and bitmaps blink in x there is no easy way unless you re willing to depend on some sort of extension as yet non existent you have to arrange for the blinking yourself either by redrawing the contents periodically or if possible by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents thanks to mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu der mouse subject how do i get a double click in xlib users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double clicking there is no good way to get only a double click in xlib because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double clicks you have to do client side timeouts unless the single click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server thus you have to do timeouts which means system dependent code on most unixish implementations you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of the x connection and then use select or something similar on that note that many user interface references suggest that a double click be used to extend the action indicated by a single click if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the single click action or the double click action thanks to mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu der mouse subject how do i render rotated text xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities leaving them up to server extensions or clients side graphics libraries your only choice if you want to stay within the core x protocol is to render the text into a pixmap read it back

borders show up i cannot do xor as the colours all stuff up i cannot use xcopyplane as that is for single planes only i want to be able to specify a colour in the pixmap to be used as the opaque colour is this possible games such as xjewel have the same problem how does the mouse pointer do it any help would be helpful you wanna do masking build a bitmap pixmap of depth one where all pixels you name opaque are that get copied and the others are use this bitmap as the clip mask in the gc used for xcopyarea and remember to adjust the clip origin coordinates to the xcopyarea blit origin the mouse pointer besides from that it is driven using ramdac analog mapping on most hardwares uses a mask too but be warned blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask is annoying slow

inria fr arnaud le hors writes in article buzz mar lion bear com buzz bear com buzz moschetti writes this is a simple x graphics question assume you have a valid window w an icon pixmap and the background mask also a pixmap for that icon you wish to place the icon at x y in w without the background question what combination of xcopyarea and gc functions are necessary i think the idea is to merge only those pixels of pixmap into w as indicated by the corresponding mask pixel value specifically the problem involves a pixmap and mask generated by the xpm libs any clues would be most appreciated xpm provides you with symbolic color names which can be specified at load time so for doing what you want i would suggest you to define a background symbol in your pixmap file which you ll set to whatever color is used by the widget or the window on which you want to put your pixmap this would surely be the simplest and fastest way to do what you want no as soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle the way to do it is masking create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are and all not to be merged are then set the clip mask of the gc to this bitmap set the clip x origin and clip y origin of the gc to the x y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use gxcopy and xcopyarea the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc o o o brain inside o o o o andre beck abpsoft mehl andre beck irs inf tu

work membership in the consortium open to any organization there are two categories of membership member for large organizations and affiliate for smaller organizations most of the consortium s activities take place via electronic mail with meetings when required as designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations typically a

the titlebar of my xterm window the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell echo esc text g where esc is the escape key text is the string you wish to have displayed and g is a control g the bel character here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories alias newcd cd echo n esc cwd g the digit in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit instead and use to change only the icon name note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the ps prompt itself note on an ibm rs is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a v subject where can i find the xterm control sequences the best source of such information is in your r sources in the file ctlseqs ms a postscript

order to use special characters such as the o umlaut you need to stty pass but also to use a charcell iso font such as xterm font medium r normal c iso xterm boldfont bold r normal c iso the family is intentionally unspecified in this example in addition you may want to set this in your shell setenv lc ctype iso for a given character above you can determine the key to use with the alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below try using man ascii for example o umlaut v is alt v and the section character is alt thanks to greg holmberg greg thirdi uunet uu net and stephen gildea gildea expo lcs mit edu subject why are my xterm menus so small you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally if you give a resource specification like this xterm geometry x then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to x for the main window this is ok as it uses characters for its size but its popup menus don t they are in pixels and show up small to set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly xterm vt geometry x subject how can i print the current selection you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command however a program by richard hesketh rlh ukc ac uk specifically for manipulating the selection will help e g xselection primary lpr finds the primary selection and prints it this command can be placed in a window manager menu or in shell scripts xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties a version is on export also available is ria ccs uwo ca pub xget selection tar z which can be adapted to do this subject how does xt use environment variables in loading resources you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xt based programs xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variables control where xt looks for application defaults files as an application is initializing xt loads at most one app defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that app defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running sun s open windows and you also have some r x applications installed in usr lib x app defaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up app defaults files in both usr lib x and usr openwin lib or wherever your openwinhome is located setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x t n openwinhome lib t n the value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of pathnames the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see xtresolvepathname n the value of the filename parameter or the application s class name t the value of the file type in this case the literal string app defaults c customization resource r only s suffix none for app defaults l language locale and codeset e g ja jp euc l language part of l e g ja t the territory part of the display s language string c the codeset part of the display s language string let s take apart the example suppose the application s class name is myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin notice the example omits locale specific lookup usr lib x t n means usr lib x app defaults myterm openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above app defaults files in the order shown as soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others the effect of this path is to search first in usr lib x then in usr openwin let s consider another example this time let s set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm ad in the current working directory then for myterm in the directory app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app defaults n the first path in the list expands to myterm ad the second expands to home app defaults myterm this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the app defaults file myterm ad in the application s source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless with r there s another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color if one of your pathname specifications had the value usr lib x t n c then the expanded pathname would be usr lib x app defaults myterm color because the c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is usr lib x l t n c r usr lib x l t n c r usr lib x t n c r usr lib x l t n usr lib x l t n usr lib x t n note some sites replace usr lib x with a projectroot in this batch of default settings the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is root l n c r root l n c r root n c r root l n root l n root n root is either the value of xapplresdir or the user s home directory if xapplresdir is not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to a single dot in r all this machinery worked differently for r compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to a dot followed by a slash thanks to oliver jones oj world std com subject how to i have the r xdm put a picture behind the log in window the answer lies in changing xdm s xrdb resource in the xdm config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources for example your usr lib x xdm xdm config file may add the line displaymanager authorize false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log in beware and also displaymanager xrdb usr lib x xdm new xrdb where that file does something for all connections along the lines of bin sh comes in with arguments display load usr lib x xdm xresources usr bin x xsetroot display bitmap usr lib x xdm new bitmap usr bin x xrdb substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client thanks to jay bourland jayb cauchy stanford edu subject why isn t my path set when xdm runs my xsession file when xdm runs your xsession it doesn t source your cshrc or login files you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environment setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or if you set your path in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script i e by starting your xsession file off with bin csh if this doesn t work also try starting off with bin sh reset path path csh c echo path export path subject how do i keep my display when i rlogin to another machine there are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv display whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x one solution is to use the clients xrsh on the r contrib tape it includes xrsh a script to start an x application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine a more recent version is on export in xrsh shar one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu you can ftp caveat emptor versions from in x xrlogin c and x xrlogind c the program packages up term and display into a single string which is stuffed into term rlogin then propagates term normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables in addition if all you need to do is start a remote x process on another host and you find rsh host n usr bin x xterm display display too simple display must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote x processes the equivalent usage would be xrsh host xterm bin sh

some directory and run mkfontdir or your system s equivalent e g bldfamily for openwindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp dir to add that full path name to the server s font path or if the directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found it is this last step that you re probably leaving out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in the path sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a badvalue error x error of failed request badvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of failed request x setfontpath this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server the mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious is the font directory you re specifying readable from the server s file system remember it s the server not the client which interprets your font directory trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it e g xset fp myfonts and the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm is the directory really a font directory if you re running an mit server or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file fonts dir if you can t find that file run mkfontdir if you re running openwindows look

is the xstuff mail archive the xstuff server is a mail response program that means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line of the message the archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index the top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it the command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index for example you can say send index fixes or index fixes a message that requests an index cannot request data if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item s named on the rest of the line to name an item you give its directory and its name for example send fixes a b you may issue multiple send requests the xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day if the work queue contains more requests than the day s quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day whenever the mailer is run to send its day s quota it sends the requests out shortest first some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses if you use such a mailer you won t get any response if you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo bar bitnet mitvma mit edu or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff expo lcs mit edu if your mailer deals in notation try sending to someplace mit eddie expo lcs mit edu

degrees do they mean anything tkld cogsci ed ac uk kevin davidson writes in my opinion a programming degree is still worth having yes but a cs degree is not a programming degree does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught computer science is a branch of maths or the course i did was i ve also done a software engineering course much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach programming the ability to program was an entry requirement try the m sc computing science course at the real newcastle university it s a conversion course but at least they teach real programming in the space of months we were taught pascal simula prolog miranda also some basic low level stuff was covered as well they also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory and some stuff about comms the pascal is to be replaced by c c i think next year i learn t this and x windows programming as well anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months depending on your tastes the selection of skills learn t can be quite wide reaching the one critiscism i would level at the course which i would have thought invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry this would probably need a slightly longer project period say six months but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course yes i know this sounds like a plug for the

balancing act between performance and useful features at this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows joe english joe trystero art com i ve found that a good font for tiling is x aka misc fixed medium r normal c iso it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun x screen and still get two column terminal windows side by side on the display with no overlap other font suggestions will be accepted the x server which server make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x server on my monochrome sun i haven t noticed much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging thanks to jonny farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson se how your server was compiled can also make a difference jeff law law schirf cs utah edu advises us that on a sun system x should be compiled with gcc version or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not using the bundled sunos compiler i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high quality commercial compilers on the market locking the server into ram has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged eg via a call to plock does this help performance at all i ve had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who s tried it i am not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm att com danny backx db sunbim be juan d martin juando cnm us es starting your server joe english joe trystero art com if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one after i changed my xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time we have a heavily loaded system without much core though this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works warner losh imp solbourne com provided me with a good explanation of why this works which i have summarized here when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts this process touches a large number of pages any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth all this activity is typically memory intensive once this initialization is done the process has reached a steady state the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation s limited resources this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve experimented with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve even tried sleep exec start x clients script and then in start x clients script i had sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you fonts loading fonts takes time and ram if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you ll get speed increases in load up time one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients or at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server this will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp ptcbu oz au joe english joe trystero art com eg my main xterm font is x so i also have twm set up to use x in all it s menus and icons etc twm s default font is x since i don t normally use x i ve eliminated one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner pictel com keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r scalable fonts use a font server about the resources file keep your xresources xdefaults file small saves ram and saves on server startup time joe english joe trystero art com one suggestion in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications for example reversevideo true then separate your resources into individual client specific resource files for example home lib app defaults in your login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults n the comp windows x frequently asked questions faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work ed so when xterm launches it loads its resources from app defaults xterm xdvi finds them in app defaults xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource file naming pattern you can check in your system app defaults directory often usr x r lib x app defaults to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name this is all documented in the xt specification pg thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel ee cornell edu kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits easier to maintain more usable fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager property as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resources applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them it also has drawbacks the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up this doesn t seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you are modifying an application s resource database you just need to re run the application without having to xrdb again xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not watch out for this i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped out when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources xt did not provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e g ifdef color is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some clients which break the rules for example neither emacs nor xvt will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that i seldom use define your display properly client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server in that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to hostname where hostname is the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to unix or by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh ras amdahl com see the display names section of the x man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name i don t think it s stock mit but at least data general and hp have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the display isn t set specially rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net jody goldberg jody algorithmics com sent me an xlib patch to change stock r to use local communication even if display is not properly set i don t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non mit patches and so have elected not to include it here hopefully mit will apply this minor lines patch themselves in the meantime if you want to try it yourself email jody ed clients if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running think also about the kind of programs you are running for example is there a smaller clock program than xclock unfortunately i haven t really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome ed i ve received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client programs some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather large others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries in this case using a non xt for example client program may actually increase the amount of ram consumed the upshot of all this seems to be don t mix toolkits that is try and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif clients etc if you use more than one then you re dragging in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment thanks to rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net duncan sinclair sinclair dcs gla ac uk sinclair uk ac gla dcs a better clock for x xcuckoo suggested by duncan sinclair

the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog this was written as a partial clone of xterm you don t have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm in it s current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm i ve heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but i ve not found any yet update march i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin brian warkentine eng sun com regarding xvt he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark bin time dd if etc termcap bs and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements we don t have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm s paging requirements are not that major as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data i d like to see it specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each mterm suggested by der mouse mouse lightning mcrcim mcgill edu available larry mcrcim mcgill edu in x mterm src mterm ball o wax i also have my own terminal emulator its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway tuning your client suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster from scott barman scott asd com comes a suggestion regarding motif text field widgets i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field examining the what was going on with xscope i found it it seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate is non zero and the focus is on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to it is not noticeable on a mhz sparc but it does make a little difference on a slower system this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server requests miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures don t use large bitmaps gif s etc as root window backgrounds the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc these take up ram and cpu power i work on a sun sparc and i m conscious of performance issues i can t comprehend it when i see people with a mb sun running xphoon as their root window i ll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation if you re

don t set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager widget again stick to as few fonts as possible better yet don t use motif at all it s an absolute pig don t create and destroy widgets on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too use a line width of in gcs on some servers this makes a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose events this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi uia ac be just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc but i didn t find the time yet i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat times faster any confirmation on this from anyone ed andre beck andre beck irs inf tu dresden de unnecessary noexpose events most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it s event loop again and again thousands of xchangegc requests this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded x apps where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection by moving it toward the client startup phase say what some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first david b lewis by day dbl osf org by night david craft uunet uu net how about this swap displays

major problem except that the x client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing timothy h panton thp westhawk uucp firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu s are mostly idle x s cpu usage is bursty so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu intensive at the same time is small if they are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your action the second factor is that context switches are expensive using cpu s halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network typically k vs k for a pipe allowing even fewer context switches other sources of information volume in o reilly s x window system series x window system administrator s guide

pleasing color and texture the only real difference is that an ms application window can contain other toplevel children while a motif application window launches its children out onto the desktop aab to those of you familiar with both guis is this correct my experience aab with x makes me think that this msw behavior is easily duplicated aab with x but i don t know msw another important difference is that msw doesn t have any window that handle sophisticated geometry management like xmform also i believe that in windows x you re limited to k of resources windows menus icons etc imho this whole discussion named motif looks like ms windogs is totally stupid the only thing remotely influenced here can be the motif window manager that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the ms w windowmanaging agent however its name is but mwm is only a small part of motif in fact mwm and motif can work without each other and if one doesn t like mwms outfit for some reason he switches to another windowmanager all this doesn t influence motif which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications and this toolkit is imho uncomparable to ms w because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the ms w interface you cannot say a porsche looks like a vw k fer only because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position motif and

abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer of the system nb some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer i m not saying that the programmer s perspective is evil or stunted after all that s what i do too i am saying that ui designers must carefully distinguish between the user programmer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system i don t recall the actual stats but something like in people can be categorized as a symbol manipulator it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim at any rate i don t think this is evidence that of users think like programmers bankers financial analysts structural engineers

like to know which c toolkit to bet on for use in a new long term project i have the same problem i have looked at motif wwl interviews gina and a few variations on the above i ve also done a cursory examination of rogue wave s view h i like view h s abstractions best of all of the toolkits i mentioned but the resulting code looks little like motif and i have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code gina allows you to write code which looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too motif like and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent c code interviews looks promising but i haven t found a free version with motif support and i m not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted and what if any specific motif support will be available over time the other libraries produce code which is less motif like but which does not make sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task at this point my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in c and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task later if osf or some credible standards setting body comes up with a c interface to motif i will change to that it does me no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions it s better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now views h is the only library i d consider right now but in our environment we d end up spending nearly to use it and i can t justify it when it s likely to cause short term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long lived

please just an opinion seeing as motif has been adopted by sun ibm hp can t remeber the other members in the recent announcement i m sure you ll see it on virtually every workstation ie sun ibm hp and dec must make up the vast majority of all hardware i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif particularly from the point of view of writing and obtaining free software as the linux and bsd communities grow however i think that motif will lose some of its grip at least in the non commercial marketplace ports of motif to both bsd and linux are available for a fee of about this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups pertaining to motif has been high i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and non commercial software ie you will only get free software using athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using the motif widget sets i can t see why if just about every workstation will come with motif by default and you can buy it for under for the free unix platforms i can t see this causing major problems side note all the x based code i am

c k ny azj kirk bu oz au bambi kirk bu oz au david j hughes writes i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif particularly from the point of view of writing and obtaining free software as the linux and bsd communities grow however i think that motif will lose some of its grip at least in the non commercial marketplace ports of motif to both bsd and linux are available for a fee of about this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups pertaining to motif has been high i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and non commercial software ie you will only get free software using athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using the motif widget sets i can t see why if just about every workstation will come with motif by default and you can buy it for under for the free unix platforms i can t see this causing major problems i think you will find that the active linux and bsd communities are populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying any money for software otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial unix an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always available this is probably similar in the bsd community however i m not really involved there many people using linux like to stay at the cutting bleeding edge ie when kernel patches c library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems the prime requirement for all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license hence linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview individuals may write software requiring motif but i doubt it is widely adopted regards richard goochre expose events

might wear my socialistic hacker hat for a moment i tar news and motif with the same brush and that brush is not technical begging everyone s pardon i was not slamming motif nor was i necessarily plugging flaming the two i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in rick digibd from rick digibd digibd com rick richardson rick this is one area where microsoft nt has a big advantage since rick they control the whole show there are no issues like this where rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it i remember when sunview was hot stuff and am not by that statement endorsing sun and its products this is just my experience and when openwindows became hot stuff that was when i started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying anything that was deemed proprietary including openwindows i mentioned motif in the same breath because that is what sun has decided to turn its attention to not because i hate it mr richardson s position i believe is a healthy one and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy nt if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized

systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it s own monitor i have a number of x level questions regarding this we are devloping on unix systems using x motif platform will be predominantly sun s probably with ports to rs as well i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens and not multiple x displays given this is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other there s nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens do i have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there what are they who sells them is a multi screen window manager the only way i can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x y plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead i am assuming that this is not a major issue that i can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application any thoughts or suggestions from past experience are more than welcome jo pelkey phone battelle pacific northwest labs fax mail

really neat add puke here and are overjoyed to be able to use more than k of memory its a major improvement for windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for granted most of windows users only use pcs for text processing or running rd party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue my ideal operating system binary compatible across all plaforms it should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so i don t have to have bin mac bin dos bin dec bin sun bin hp etc multi cpu so i can use the cpus on my pc and w s and mac and transputers and dsps i don t know a single site which has gone for a single vendor i am not going to trade in mflops per h transputer or ultra fast fft on dsp chips note nt runs on symmetric multi cpu systems built in portable gui graphics tools you can call drawbutton or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display it should also translate graphics commands on the fly so i can use pc graphics s w on my workstation and x software on my pc i think guis are not just nice to have but essential configurable front end so you can make it look like unix or dos or nt or os and run shell scripts or command bat files object oriented so i can program easily under it and not have to re invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access

uva nl bram writes i am using an x server that provides visuals pseudocolor bit truecolor bit and directcolor bit lucky dog a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent which uses the default visual which is tc in the xlib reference guide from o reilly one can read in the section about xcteatewindow something like in the current implementation of x when using a visual other than the parent s be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a badmatch occurs this warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the x r guides it applies with equal force to earlier versions presumably only recently did the author s decide it was important enough to mention the necessity it refers to has always been there but it s been implicit in the way createwindow requests default some attributes of the new window however even if i pass along a suitable colourmap i still get a badmatch when i create a window with a non default visual attr colormap cmap win xcreatewindow copyfromparent border width depth inputoutput class vinfo visual visual cwcolormap attr this is because the warning you read is incomplete you have to provide not only a colormap but also a border the default border is copyfromparent which is not valid when the window s depth doesn t match its parent s specify a border pixmap of the correct depth or a border pixel and the problem should go away there is another problem i can t find anything to indicate that copyfromparent makes any sense as the border width parameter to xcreatewindow your xlib implementation probably defines copyfromparent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the xlib implementation not providing stricter type checking to be fair i m not entirely certain it s possible for xlib to catch this der mouse

used to provide additional displays for example say you hade a sparcstation with an sbus expansion chassis you could put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system you could then attach from to keyboard mice allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays you could have screen display screen displays screen displays or screen display and screen display basically any combination because of this we at megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi screen and multi display they are quite different in meaning and at least in x have

writes i have a peculiar color problem with macx apple s macintosh x server i d like to know if others have seen the same problem it s happened with the current version and with version when some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors it doesn t happen for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some motif clients i expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap it therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors this makes it look ugly until it s window gets priority then macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications are having to make do with it s colormap this is a problem with all color x servers or at least all color xservers i have seen when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap my solution is usually to avoid colormap greedy apps and display applications where color is just icing on the cake in

article c qtkk wp cup hp com defaria cup hp com andy defaria writes article crossposted from hp windows author was andy defaria posted on mon apr gmt for some reason the following code causes my x application to beep whenever i intercept a keystroke and change it s meaning the intent of this code it to allow date fields the following special keys tt insert today s date bump day up by one bump day down by one i hardcoded some dates for this example perhaps i shouldn t be using an xmtext field for this for some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys of tt are hit why the idea of this code is to interpret these keys having the special meaning implied by the code i would like to get rid of the beeping but as far as i can tell i m not doing the beep and am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring code deleted from the xmtextfield man page during discussion of resources xmnverifybell specifies whether a bell will sound when an action

mapped window that contains xlib graphics a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events e g window manager driven exposures take care of rendering the new image using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped what we need to do is somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior if i understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app specific code draws xlib graphics on the window it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using xsendevent and specifying a region if you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects you can use xcreateregion to create a region xunionrectwithregion to add the new object polygons to the region and then either use the region to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they

advantage of the graphics library gl available on our ibm rs sgi s gl i believe is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window

monthly question about xcopyarea and expose events in article buzz apr lion bear com buzz bear com buzz moschetti writes nd posting of the question that just doesn t seem to get answered suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events e g window manager driven exposures take care of rendering the new image using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped what we need to do is somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior to incrementally update the contents of windows i use the following trick set the window background to none call xcleararea display window true restore the window background to its correct value the call to xcleararea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window in order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased i encapsulate the operations with self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server xgrabserver display client

rectangle suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the window is mapped the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item what does this have to do with my original question i previously stated that i did an xcopyarea of the depth pixmap to the screen just to make sure that my image had data and it did this is not a problem with expose events it has to do with xcopyplane not working does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that xcopyplane works this would be very helpful thanks what it has to do with your original question is this many times beginning x users heck experienced x users too write small test programs many times they forget to draw only in response to expose events and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application s graphics show up and sometimes they don t we re just trying to eliminate all the easy explanations for why you re not seeing your graphics that being said why don t you try copying different planes to your window other than try to see it you get any output since you re

displaying some graphics typing a ret while the tektronics mode xterm future reference to this will be tek term is active makes the xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the

the xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it subsequent selections from the xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move the tek term to the top if the tek term has been iconized to conserve screen space it stays an icon the desired behavior one of two options whichever of the windows that is

factor of on average than the sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that the x protocol communication is slowing things down

client server communications mechanism you are using is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps these are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much cheaper also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary xsyncs or running in xsynchonize mode if you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the x server you should use the shared memory

login procedure on the x terminals using tcp ip since xdm is basically just an x windows client shouldn t i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well xdm is not just an x window client xdm has its own protocol xdmcp that operates of ucp on port it does provide a login window which is an x window client as to using decnet protocol looking through the source for xdm from x r that i have here it seems that the bare bones code is there but not completely there my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client it is making tcp ip specific socket calls in this case the answer would be no you can not run xdm over decnet is this right or not any feedback is appreciated thanks from my look at the source it seems you cannot run it over decnet as shipped with x r patrick

an ibm rs running aix v i am having the following problems many of my imakefile s have contructs like this is a makefile at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile most of the c preprocessors that i have used will not treat such a as appearing at the start of the line thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive the cpp fails when it determines that this is not a known directive i have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix several imakefiles use as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter the aix cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions i would appreciate information about on your solutions perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed also do you know of other cpp s that behave similarly since i do not have easy access to news a response to white billy po gis prc

dcr mail ast cam ac uk derek c richardson writes hi i m new to this group so please bear with me two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation of raster files with sunview becoming rapidly obselete i ve finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview i put together a quick test and i ve found that xputimage is considerably slower factor of on average than the sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that the x protocol communication is slowing things down or xputimage is inefficient or both using xputimage your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client server communications mechanism you are using is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps these are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much cheaper also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary xsyncs or running in xsynchonize mode paul pmartz dsd es com evans sutherlandxsun not running on sparcclassic i ve installed x r with patches for solaris on our sparcstation

start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color once i determine if a cell is read only i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as used by my application so that it doesn t later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read write to another application so far the only way i ve figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full

is to create another gc wherein i use the gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is something that should be avoided is there any way i can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too i also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area as this degrades performance very badly thank you gopalx terminal

in this configuration x windows applications particularly xdvi work fine however if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error unable to load iso font the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window if i start the xterm with a different font using the fn option no problems it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesn t appear to be a problem in the font directories hash tables other than rewriting the xterm app defaults file to use a different font and hope

posted this a while ago and didn t receive one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply unfortunately the specification for xgrabkey doesn t allow anymodifier to be combined with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case ctrl any key q in ora vol in the section on accelerators it says for information on how to specify translation tables see vol this is so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource if you go to vol it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for example the translation shift key q quit will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as the shift key and the q key this is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs it s not true for menu accelerators if you re a motif implementor i d suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics changed to support the feature i described above otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user s expectations because menu accelerators are not the same thing as translations is it possible to supply accelerator for a menu entry if you mean menu accelerator no it s not possible that s according to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you can t use xtinstallaccelerators i can t think of a reason why not how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case what i want is ctrl o and ctrl o to both be accelerators on one menu entry there is a workaround for motif users in addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the xmpushbutton gadget set an xtnaccelerators resource on the shell

in looking at the xview code mentioned above there s documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the x r distribution actually i just finished writing a motif animation program take lots of image data and display it pretty darn fast when using on server pixmaps or shared memory i had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly testing both methods side by side they were just about equal the advantage of shm is that your x server doesn t grow to ridiculous sizes but pixmaps can work over a network and are removed if your application dies one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging shm apps shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems e g ultrix seem to allow only a small number of segments to be attached to a process at once consequently a redraw becomes xshmattach xshmputimage xshmdetach on dec systems and dec s bit displays like the ones i tend to use most often don t seem to support the extension maybe someone compiled them wrong and using pixmaps causes the x server to crash failed mallocs so one has to use the local unix domain socket which really isn t that bad one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one in short allowing all three forms of display within the program is a good thing minus shm if running over a network and let the user pick whatever feels fastest i just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it robpixmaps and colormaps sent through selections i want to be able to send a pixmap from one client to the next along with this i want to send the colormap and foreground

since two windows aren t enough i have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning in case you re not familiar with squeezed titles here s a crude picture figure title a title b title c this is the window b hides window c but body of the you can still see c s title window window a which is squeezed right figure squeezed titles allow me to have about such windows in each stack with easy access and per stack is usually more than i really need since i also insist on having a virtual wm the only problem is that the title location is static that is it is configured in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager doing so is cumbersome and time consuming therefore i have implemented f squeeze left center right functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this title a this is the body of the window window a to this title a this is the body of the window

shared memory putimage also mentioned by nkissebe delphi beckman uiuc edu nick kisseberth looks interesting but i need someone to point me to some documentation is this method likely to give better results than server resident pixmaps i d also be interested in looking at the xview code mentioned above there is no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manages these resources having to deal with limited off screen memory is the bane of the server implementor s existence i have worked with graphics devices where the off screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display is faster than off screen to display requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the f b followed by a write if your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in cpu main memory the rates you can get through mit shm are likely to be equal maybe a tad slower depending on your os s implementation of shared memory to copyarea from pixmap to window which is also then just a copy from cpu main memory to graphics device one advanage of mit shm is that if your images are large you don t end up growing the size of the server process to hold them one disadvantage of the mit shm is that in its sample implementation there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden violent death e g kill you have to be mindful of

another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply unfortunately the specification for xgrabkey doesn t allow anymodifier to be combined with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case ctrl any key q in ora vol in the section on accelerators it says for information on how to specify translation tables see vol this is so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource if you go to vol it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for example the translation shift key q quit will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as the shift key and the q key this is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs it s not true for menu accelerators if you re a motif implementor i d suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics changed to support the feature i described above otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user s expectations because menu accelerators are not the same thing as translations is it possible to supply accelerator for a menu entry if you mean menu accelerator no it s not possible that s according to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you can t use xtinstallaccelerators i can t think of a reason why not how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case what i want is ctrl o and ctrl o to both be accelerators on one menu entry i find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing if i were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators i would have one resource called accelerators that took a translation table period i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed as soon as the end user specified one it would be active and automatically installed to get multiple accelerators on a single menu item i d do something like menuitem accelerators override n ctrl key m fire n shift key l fire n the accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a ctrl m show up in your menuitem object why

on an ibm rs running aix v i am having the following problems many of my imakefile s have contructs like this is a makefile at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile most of the c preprocessors that i have used will not treat such a as appearing at the start of the line thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive the cpp fails when it determines that this is not a known directive i have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix several imakefiles use as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter the aix cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions i would appreciate information about on your solutions perhaps

mod mask mod mask eg sgi s vendor server has mod mask being numlock whereas solaris openwindows has mod mask for numlock is there an unambiguous means of determining numlock s mask at runtime for any given server sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance you ll have to check the keysym s on each of the keys for each modifier the one with numlock in its mapping is the modifier you

pgdn they all seem to have either the same or no keycode i have a feeling this can t be fixed in emacs itself but that i need to do some xmodmap stuff can someone help me unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs i ran into this problem a while back my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences for example the sequence esc b would indicate that the home key was pressed with the shift key down you could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such as shift return if anybody wants these changes they re welcome to them but you ll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file x term c maybe if someone at osf is interested i can send them the tweaks but i imagine they ve got bigger fish to fry hopefully including the much talked about emacs v if there s sufficient interest i ll post the mods somewhere although this probably isn t the appropriate group for it notes this special code will only apply if you let emacs create its own x window if you run it in plain old tty mode which includes xterm windows then it s business as usual the patches i made were to version under sun os i also did this a while back

other words i want host and logname to appear as a title of opened xterm and host when xterm is closed how can i do it apologies if i m answering something already answered in the faq our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately so i haven t seen the faq lately to check two ways when you start the xterm you can use command line options n icon name to set the icon label t window title to set the window title title window title equivalent to t window title you can use escape sequences to change things on the fly the basic escape sequence is esc p some arbitary text bel where esc and bel are the ascii escape and bell characters p is an ascii decimal digit or depending on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title or both and some arbitary text is your desired label string hence this command will set the window icon title echo your title goes here c to set just the icon title echo your title goes here c to set just the window title echo your title goes here c of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax depending on how the echo command works on your system and what shell you are using i ve shown system v semantics under bourne or korn shells hint for sun os users use usr bin echo instead of bin echo or csh s built in echo otherwise you ll have to embed literal esc and bel characters in the string instead of using convenient octal sequences if you want your titlebar updated continously say to show your current directory hostname or somesuch then you ll have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence in the prompt string itself sometimes not mark lanzo kd qlz lanzo tekelec com xxre how do i find my appcontext

to get the latest version for gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only either mit shm to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it or pex opengl

that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time if i try to pop it up a nd time rd th time it is much slower the shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its positioning request the window manager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly received thanks for this clue and thanks to derek ho also for a pointer in the same direction one solution due to derek ho when the popup is popped up we setvalue its location which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup the slow response can be avoided by calling getvalue first and only using setvalue if the required location is different the problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup so that the setvalue really does change the location of the popup we tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem the solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows use twm or mwm rather than olwm use olwm with resource wmtimeout only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed this is obviously

focus processing i am using x r and motif currently although i will also be working with open look in the future what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window let s say for example that window a is on top of window b in the window hierarchy normally if the user clicks the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of window a under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window a from the research and testing i ve done so far it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this case motif i haven t found any way to override this default processing through standard x window functions i can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events but i can t find any way to tell motif not to make the switch the temporary solution i ve currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works when i detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed i manually force the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call and beep with the xbell function this provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice does anyone know how i can

other than the dialogshell i get the default colormap but i d like it so that if my cursor is over any window of my application i get my colormap i think this is correct behavior remember the default colormapfocuspolicy is keyboard meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus since the dialog is modal mwm won t allow keyboard focus onto your main shell and so it won t allow cmap focus either since it sounds as though you have keyboardfocuspolicy pointer i suggest you set colormapfocuspolicy pointer also that way the cmap focus won t slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path if you have keyboardfocuspolicy explicit you can set cmap focus explicit also but you then need a binding to f focus color probably on mb david brooks dbrooks osf org open software foundation

undoubtedly the worst gui i have used out of that riscos mswombles and x simply because it does not provide enough keyboard shortcuts windows i must confess i quite like cover your ears because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the mouse stuff delete the user rather than making things easier and there should always be the option to do it your way if you want to which is why i like the unix x combination so much it s so customizable hear hear i agree completely one thing i can t stand about the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use the mouse what if your mouse breaks your whole system is down i like the mouse it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around etc but for most work the keyboard and hot keys are times faster than using the mouse sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it before your are experienced a month two speaking of pcs at the moment i don t think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in less time if you are experienced all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on unix especially since unix is at least more powerful than dos and at least more user unfriendly as wellre x on amiga in article yd ie utoronto ca garym ie utoronto ca gary murphy writes i m new to the hardware and with a mandate to port some x based stereo

tcp ip protocol analyzer tcpview is the result of several problems we had at uw we have several network general sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets these are good tools but they are heavy hard to find when you need one limited in their software expandibility difficult to use to upload data for analysis cannot be remotely operated and cannot resolve names with dns requiring much manual manipulation of the name table we also sometimes use tcpdump but we found it too difficult for most people did not have enough information for many protocols could not be used interactively could not handle tcp streams and could not read sniffer files however tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features tcpview has been tested on a decstation and sun under ultrix and sunos respectively it should work on the same systems as tcpdump it compiles with cc and gcc on the dec and sun to build tcpview you will need motif or better the following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp cac washington edu in pub networking tcpview tar z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview sun tar z sun binaries tcpview dec tar z dec mips ultrix binaries what tcpview adds to tcpdump easier interface enhanced protocol decoding hex display of frame capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer s name ethernet address host table can easily follow a stream highlighting out of order frames can send tcp data to an external file or filter for additional processing changes to tcpdump new features now reads and writes network general sniffer files when used with r the file type will be automatically detected can now read in and use an snmp mib file the hex format has been changed new time options have been added options were added

n implementation from mit s x r release xsi and ximp our original implementation of the toolkit uses xsi our toolkit manages each character s size based on our own font management system in order to do that the wchar t typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets this means that if one wchar t type compound string with ascii and kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchar t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment s locale in this case if the locale is japanese each wchar t character will be classified either to iso jisx or so we need a function to do this the function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is we could not find any public x r function to do that and inevitably used xsi s internal functions to construct that function the following is the source code of that function decomposecharacterset i n h this may look like c code but it is really c id i n h v iima exp iima ifndef i n h define i n h include x xlib h extern int decomposecharacterset const wchar t wc str in int wc len in char buf out int buflen in out

directory and compiled a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with its os version of hp ux when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing xmbctidtocsid code xmbfscs code xwcdecomposeglyphcharset code xfallbackconvert code we had used mit release version of x r and its xsi implementation until hp up and ran applications successfully one of the reasons to use xsi was that because hp did not release hp s x r until the os and we had no way to know how hp s r would be implemented we had hoped xsi s popularity and used its internal functions the hp s linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented we observe from hp s libx a they used some ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used mit s vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in mit s ximp for xsi does not seem to lead us a solution my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like decomposecharacterset listed above is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar t type strings depending on locales if it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in hp s x r as we did for mit s r in order to render a wchar t type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string we have no way to find out that without any hp s x r source files we want to know how we can use that for our goal any help or comments would be highly appreciated i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area even if it is not hp s implementation thank you

options another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way another way would be to use getgeometry to find out where you are relative to the frame and translatecoordinates to find out where your window s upperleft corner really is as i ve said before there s no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration if your window has been reparented you can t assume that the window you re parented to is the window that holds all of the window

because the hardware actually lives in yuv space the translation rgb yuv will introduce some rounding error we tried to ship an x server once that only supported a bit truecolor visual the main

visual classes but many clients don t bother to check they just start throwing xstorecolor calls at you though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many clients that it s easier for

misuse of the forms by the trade rags this probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags if they can t even get the name of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have to say i used to think this way and not just about x for example incorrect english constructs such as its raining or it s window id annoy me however there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world indeed the fact that x won out over news was really down to popular opinion i know we all think it s technically superior as well on a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour being irish and hence using english english as opposed to american english i always use the latter except of course for api terms such as xalloccolor and colormap in a world that uses the term windows to refer to microsoft windows perhaps the time has come to accept x windows as a valid term for x i think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say the x window system and let s face it almost everyone uses it ultimately we all need product sales to more than just x literate people in this respect product recognition is important and a short snappy descriptive title x is positively obscure will help when dealing with the average punter it s sad i thought i was a software engineer indeed it is unfortunate that x did not become popularly known as windows and let ms worry about whether it should be called microsoft windows or the microsoft window system or how about just plain microsoft to summarise or should that be summarize the point of this message i think there are far more pressing issues facing the x community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system or should that be windowing system whatever gets recognised is fine by me i agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say however i would be reluctant to come to this

there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world well yes and no i don t particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate but i do think it s worth pointing out that popular usage is not always sufficient excuse in this case for example i think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name would you feel compelled to change it probably not the same is true of x the x window system x x and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name in fact some of them are trademarked names the fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point as for the trade publications that promulgate things like x window or x windows or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by journalists would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn t be bothered to get the name of his her source right would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong popular usage is as it may be but i for one am all

will incorporate some improvements by stefan schwarz and possibly will support x r and motif x note to all of those who keep copies of the archive please retrieve this distribution during off peak hours and delete all previous copies here is the original announcement history the university of lowell supported by a grant of the open software foundation has developed a wrapper library that encapsulates motif widgets in c classes all resources of these widgets can now be set through member functions while objects can be used in callback functions the library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at however the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights and only worked under x r due to lack of subsequent fundings the bindings are no longer actively supported by the university of lowell i ronald van loon at a certain point last year have taken the lowell bindings fixing the bugs i came across adding missing memberfunctions and enhancing functionality and made the bug fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp made possible by rick murphy at dec new release i am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the motif bindings this release offers full motif and x r support support for xbae widgetset two additional widgets written by myself that can be used to indicate progress in an application imake support nb this release relies heavily on the existence of imake and its config files on your site i have tried to provide the bindings with a standard makefile tweakable for those unfortunates without imake i have not severely tested the standard makefile though contact me if you have problems the reason for calling this a gamma release lies in the fact that i do not have a multitude of platforms to test the imake files on lots of testfiles even somewhat useful programs an article i wrote on the usage of motif x and c previously posted on usenet where to get the new motif bindings ftp anonymous ftp at decuac dec com directory pub x note please be patient as the network link is quite slow please do not ftp large files during working hours also note that there is also a motif jan tar z file at this site this is an old version of the bindings e mail those who don t have ftp can send me e mail and i will send the bindings by e mail request those who use the bindings and find bugs or see room for improvement please contact me and i will try to incorporate them in a future release in case of bugs a bug fix of course more information contact me at rvloon cv ruu nl if you are

where the pointer is i have noticed in framemaker x on both the sgi and sun platforms that certain dialogs such as column layout for example respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is pointer how is this done i would like to emulate this behavior in my application it seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus alternatively i m open to any suggestions as to what is the right way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one s keyboard focus policy is

regarding standard colormaps the x r documentation says usually a window manager creates these colormaps i wonder what window manager the writer had in mind neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps standard colormaps were spec d with the intention that window managers would make them available this doesn t mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped

the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one clut i don t believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap an example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use xa rgb best map or whatever it s called under x r if you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap if you can t do that then you ll get

the best lookup method my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table i would like to do it the second way but i can t seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers i know that when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping a mappingnotify event is generated non maskable which i can pick up and modify my internal table but i don t seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap if i use xt all o reilly has to say is is automatically handled by xt if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing this all stems from problems with users of the sun keyboard and the numlock plus various alt meta etc modifier requirements i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window i want it at the same y coord and their right left sides touching what i need to ask for is the x y coord of the window manager s border for

qdeck com support qdeck com technical support writes in article qtk rn picasso cssc syd tansu com au gpatapis boyd tansu com au writes what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running dv x is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time anyone have any ideas i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a real world example here at quarterdeck we have roughly people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other it s not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe concentrators so you have people on each segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have people running programs off it you re going to see some slowdowns because you re now on effectively a mhz of course dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have working programs running you ll know it well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year the link i want to use though isdn k is costly and the bandwidth limited that s why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic goes through it having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth hmmm has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all are you running any standard ms windows programs like word what sort of packets go blazing through what size link do you have mb or mb what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you re going to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also what do you mean by network things i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes

if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don t have the keyborads focus you can always ask for keypress events from the root window then you get all the keypresses and you always know what have been pressed an even more pointed question is there an easy means of making an x keyboard act like a pc keyboard ie capslock is active and the user presses shift a i d like to get a lowercase a instead of a i think this is just a question of how to implement xlookupstring you can always write another function that interprets the keypresses as you
