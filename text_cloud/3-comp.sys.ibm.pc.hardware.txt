it a lot nicer when you re switching printer emulations around norton i don t have much experience with but when a friend s system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the originals and

all kinds of complaints regarding gateways lately on here i thought i post my recent pleasant experiences my machine dx v this past friday this was two weeks to the day from when i called the order in upon unboxing it i found everything to be in perfect order all the peripherals i ordered were properly installed jumbo cd rom i was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the gateway documentation all software came with the original disks and manuals the gateway manual itself is in a nice ring binder the ati gup came with build drivers all other software i specified microsoft office was properly installed the machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly it s been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature i think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it it s up and running dos with no problems i ve also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications i used the dos interlink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at k baud it then maps the other machines two hard disks as my disks f g you can cd to these drives and either run programs or copy files it s almost like a peer peer lan except you can also run programs on the other machine it s not a two way street the other machine is the server and this machine is the client so thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff for a bundled dos utility its very impressive my jumbo took about minutes to back up mb of data i also by passed any potential gateway monitor problems by taking the

pins and select the second drive drive if you have the rom it s a auto config and i ll have to look up how to do it i don t have the big book right here are the jumpers on the card drive set correctly see above you might have problems if the s jumpers are not right also at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and good on the jumper on the try moving it to the opposite side of the drive it s one or the other the narrow data cable goes to j i ve thrown it on j a few times and banged my head for a day is my system s bios in need of an upgrade dunno ibm roms had to be later

considering buying one or the other definitely go for the dx with a nice size external cache the performance is far greater the dx only has the internal k cache to work with at mhz while the dx has a

and chip simms and one cannot use them interchan mg if you use one you have to use all of the same type don t believe everything you are told i can tell you that mixing them between banks ok and i can t see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds e g mixing of ns and ns simms in one bank the two only differ in the type of chips it uses assuming that the simms are mx bit wide here is the two equivalent configuration the chip simm uses two bit wide mbit m of bit nibbles and one bit wide mbit chip for a total of bit wide mbyte the bit simm uses nine bit wide mbit chips these are equivalent because of the way that it is pinned on the simm board at the simm interface they both act as bit wide mbyte simms sorry if too techie for ya mg similarly one cannot plug in two mb simms and one mb simms to gi mg the system a total of meg why is that so if my system supports mg of meg it has simm slots can i plug in mb simms to give my mg mb that sounds correct the problem is that if your computer takes bit wide simms you can not mix different sizes in one bank why you ask simple if you understand why there is banks assuming you have a bit cpu dx or the data bus e g the mechanism to retrieve data from memory is bits wide so the computer expects to see bits when it asks for data to get that bandwidth bit wide the motherboard links mx one bit is not data but parity so i will ignore that in this simple explaination to get bits bits that means that a simm in a bank stores only of the bit wide data if you have a bit bus two mx simms are linked together to get bit wide data which is the reason why banks are simms wide and bit banks are simms wide if your computer required mx e g bit wide data with parity bits used in some ps s and asts you could upgrade by one simm at a time hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your question was not simple i could of just said because i said so rdd winqwk b unregistered evaluation copy kmail d w net hq

video and disk which are far better than the prior value point systems and you get vesa local bus for future upgrades we are going to buy three of them with monitors also a newly available and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to ultrastor f caching scsi disk controller and either the ati gup or the viper graphics board do not buy a sx sytem my personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss free when you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes i e they get you coming and going translated this means take infrequent but large steps you are far better

failing as a sort of auto sense this is how you can sometimes use slower ram in a machine you either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow ram in which case all memory will run at that slower rate or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower ram will act like faster ram and you won t crash putting faster ram in won t speed things up unless you tell the machine

depeche mode nothing music for the masses stephen r husak husak ux cso uiuc edu univerisity of illinois does it do it to all tapes were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch the reason i ask is that i bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole it was only on a few tapes of a set did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels if you have not yet open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base as you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to as you are doing it look for a couple of little holes in the tape these are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape the holes are spaced a couple of inches apart my best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker anyhow if the tape has the holes then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean the function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes the tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out when the hole goes by the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop if the mirror is dirty or out of alighment unlikely since it is made into the case you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape if the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good then either the pickup or the led of the sensor system has failed or is dirty if you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r w head assembly if it looks clean and nothing is in its way then

only bits then anything on the bus can access only mb even if i have mb on the motherboard so far i agree with the arguments then the writer claims that glitches can occur in systems with over mb

can t remember your name and he said that even though you have a local bus hard disk controller your performances won t be that much greater because of the disk s throughtput so what is the use of having a fast bus if the peripherals can t cope with it something to bear in mind is what the v in vlb stands for v for video the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster this is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory since there are usually vlb slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other two how about an vlb ethernet card move the data into the card at odd mb s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over mb s do do however free the local bus for other cards some

card either but from a disk data point of view why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi tasking data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster does it have a better cache system i thought scsi was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached if we are only talking about a single drive explain why scsi is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive you are making the same mistake i did you are confusing the drive interface to the data throughput interface again from my mac ibm info sheet available by ftp on sumex aim stanford edu in the info mac report as mac ibm compare txt expansion both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus only some monitors and cd rom apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers while ibm has no exact controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities on ibm machines main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the end any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm scsi devices per scsi controller bit asynchronous mb s ave and synchronous mb s max transfer base bit scsi requires a scsi controler chip and can provide only fast scsi not wide scsi which are both bit interfaces see scsi scsi devices per scsi controller in scsi mode scsi is fully scsi complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast scsi since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware which tends to be very expendsive and software transfer speeds are mb s with mb s burst bit mb s with mb s burst bit and mb s with mb s burst bit wide and fast scsi in scsi mode is limited to devices and reduced bit or bit fast only throughput due to the difference between scsi and wide scsi ports ibm hd interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development ide integrated device electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mb s max so at its lowest setting scsi interface in asynchronous scsi mode averages the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode in full scsi mode it blows poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi comes from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the scsi through put the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc which in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its cost is unwarented and so scsi is expencive that is the effect of the rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost scsi allows

the card at odd mb s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over mb s how about mb s for bit vlb or mb s for quickring apple s implimentation of vlb byte quickring is interesting in that it allows interleaving with other card so that the mb s can be divided among many cards at the same time nubus and mca are about the only card interfaces able to do anything with that kind of speed and even nubus ditzes around at mb s with a burst mode mb s mca also called micro channel ibm s and bit bus allows use of more than one cpu in a computer dct and anything can talk to anything as fast

for anyone that may be familiar with isa and eisa sytem configurations after i switch the isa boards into the eisa board all of the cards are isa the system seems to work with no problem what so ever but some of the interupt problems that we had with the isa board continue with the eisa board is it my understanding that the eisa board should be able to handle irq conficts when running windows problem when running our network via telnet tcp ip with windows running the system kicks us out of windows irq confict within windows i assume also are there any memory address problems that will happen when the boards are switched base memory that is as far as i know if you are using eisa mother board you have to use also eisa cards or else your computer system will be slower than when you re using isa board with isa cards bill that s nonsense you can use isa cards in an eisa system without problem and at the same speed as in an isa system lukere original ibm pc specs in article apr ucbeh

western digital hard drive to the machine the existing drive is currently a western digital as well and is working fine but i do not have any documentation available for configuring the master slave relationship necessary for a c d drive setup the first drive is currently formatted to tandy dos v but i am eventually going to upgrade both to ms dos v the drives themselves are both model number wd a circa they are cyl head drives a note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a setting cyl head write pre landing zone there are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that i presume are for setting up the master slave originally the drive in the machine had none currently i was suggested to try the far right looking at the back for master and the middle jumper for the slave when booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d drive it does flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive i would not even know how to do that any and all help on this is

is the second attempt at creating comp os os programmer porting and comp os os setup and renaming comp os os programmer to comp os os programmer misc the first attempt failed in the summer of the voting deadline was august the voting rules state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started after a six month waiting period in this case it is march this is the first attempt at

details has spurred a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms such as emacs less awk grep sed xscheme ispell flex yacc and much more borland has released its c c compiler for os x allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos and later windows as more people are discovering os x the number of people asking questions about os s compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc multimedia is becoming popular os supports windows multimedia extensions using win os furthermore ibm is including direct multimedia support in os starting with version in addition to using win os any non trivial software will have bugs os is not exempt especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os so far ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks e g the service pak for free free from bbss and ftp sites or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes read comp os os misc for details proposed charters a create comp os os programmer porting unmoderated it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and spur additional development the group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms such as dos windows unix etc toolkits which aid in program portability including porting tools such as mirrors and so forth b rename comp os os programmer misc unmoderated to keep the structure of the os newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp os os programmer should be renamed to comp os os programmer misc comp os os programmer misc will still be the newsgroup for os programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of os in an unmoderated setting c create comp os os setup unmoderated it will be devoted to os system setup topics including the availability of device drivers compatibility information installation procedures system requirements and overall performance optimization d create comp os os multimedia unmoderated it will provide a forum for discussion of multi media issues e create comp os os bugs unmoderated it will provide a forum for os system bug reports bug diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system patches and corrective service disks and so forth note

writes point of view why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi tasking data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster does it have a better cache system i thought scsi was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached if we are only talking about a single drive explain why scsi is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive ide integrated device electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mb s max why don t you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you re blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what s the point who says ide is limited to megs sec what about vlb ide does anyone know how they perform so at its lowest setting scsi interface in asynchronous scsi mode averages the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode in full scsi mode it blows poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can as implimented on what system the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi comes from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the scsi through put given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what does a meg megs sec scsi drive cost the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc which in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its cost is unwarented and so scsi is expencive that is the effect of the rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost the original cga cart back in was i think the original ega card or pga was scsi has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price mainly because we re talking about pc s and not sun s or sparc or sgi or name your favorite unix workstation that is after millions of pc buying decisions over the years scsi has had plenty of time to come down in price i won t argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi tasking os s when managing data from

dram for the video and thanks to orchid i got a fix from their tech support it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual i assume it would come with memory ordered from them so i guess i should be glad they didn t just say buy the memory from us or something like that the one thing that i was puzzled by was why there was not a x x k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode my ati ultra plus can handle that given mb of memory all the mb buys you on the fahrenheit is x x just one more mode geez had i known i wouldn t have bothered i asked them why and all i got was your point is well taken but orchid s software developers are busy with other projects so to get to the point finally are there any s c drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes i d love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it s not so easy to exchange these things unless they re broken if you want these modes steer away from orchids s c cards ie vlb or va vlb at least until their developers are less busy if the magazines are to believed i ve only

technology and they use the micronics eisa vlb motherboard i said that this might be a silly question since i believe that micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while i never heard of cache i am however leaning towards the ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support hr days wk and a better warrantee years micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired edge technologies and i m not sure how much i should trust the company i would really appreciate any input on this is the micron machine the clear choice does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company has anyone ever heard of cache motherboards should i go with micron just because it has the micronics motherboard

just installed a new colorado jumbo tape backup unit from gateway and i have a couple of complaints with it i don t know how common or serious these problems may be i would appreciate some feedback from others who have used this system btw this is on a dx v tower system i have a similar configuration colorado mb on dx tower the problems are o firstly gateway shipped me only mb tapes even though the drive is a mb unit when i called to complain they only said that s all we carry and with compression you can fit mb on one tape maybe so but then why did i pay extra for the large capacity tape drive you got suckered in the same way i did silly me believing that the logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity the people who do this sort of thing for a living call it marketing lawyers who prosecute it call it fraud perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on their corporate headquarters o i have about mb of data on my c drive i choose the space optimizing compression scheme and started a full backup the software estimated it would take about minutes it took hours does this sound about right this is a bit long my system takes about minutes to do the same thing usually hours particularly if the tape is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for the write is too small is there any way to change the block size or write buffer size so it s bigger o during the backup about a dozen files came up with access denied errors most of these were in c windows system comm drv keyboard drv shell dll etc but also c windows progman exe and a couple of files in the c tape directory anyone else had this happen this is because the files are opened by dos the files in the tape directory are likely the executable file or the configuration file for the tape system i would recommend running the backup from dos so it will make a complete backup of the tape directory thanks for any and all feedback on this system i d also appreciate hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges preferably mb size the mb cartridges won t do you any good since the drive won t write mb of physical data on the tape thanks pd brent williams brentw netcom com san

on what you d like your joystick for i ve seen gravis joysticks at radio shack they seemed flimsy and didn t fit well in my hand i have heard on c s i p games that they don t last well less than a year on flightsims one redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick i recently purchased a ch flightstick there aren t any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick i m currently using it for the wing commander series and red baron works quite well the large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free the buttons provide good tactile response you can hear and feel them well there are other models made by ch that can go up or down in features for price comparison gravis analogue joysticks sell for here compared to the i paid for a ch flightstick i think the extra is worth it just in feel best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch if you re only playing games such as castle wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input

automatically configure dos and windows for use with the adaptec however just in case something went wrong i m going to describe some of the changes needed to get windows working with the also you may have noticed that installing windows makes your pc run much slower even when you re not running windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called windows runs slowly msdos configuration the windows install program adds the smartdrive disk cache to your config sys and autoexec bat files if you follow the instructions you ll notice that you ll need to use double buffering with smartdrive this is the default setup you ll also notice that your system runs much much slower in both windows and msdos see the section called windows runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up windows configuration to get the adaptec to work with windows make sure that the enh section of the system ini file contains the entry virtualhdirq off i believe that the windows install program automatically adds this entry to system ini but i m not sure if this doesn t work for you you might want to try adding some more lines virtualhdirq off systemrombreakpoint false emmexclude a cfff you probably don t need the above lines though the systemrombreakpoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like qemm max only needed if you use such programs windows runs slowly once you do get windows running with the chances are that your system is running much slower than before if it s not it s probably because you happen to be using aspi dos sys version in your config sys file congratulations this appears to be a winning solution you are very lucky whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen if your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by smartdrive with double buffering according to the windows documentation and the microsoft technical note q smartdrive double buffering required with aspi dos sys you must use smartdrive with double buffering enabled while this works it really slows down your pc i once estimated that this slowed my pc down by a factor of five as i consider this unacceptable i looked for other solutions unfortunately you cannot just disable double buffering if you do windows in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run windows what you can do is one of the following use other drivers that provide double buffering it is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double buffering or by a bug in smartdrive use a driver that provides vds services vds stands for virtual dma services this is a standard which is supported by windows that allows bus mastering disk controllers like the to work with windows after trashing my hard disk countless times i found the following solutions none of which require using smartdrive note however that i am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably not caused by these solutions but might be see below while the following does not require smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes windows run much much faster if you do not have the aspi dos sys driver or you do not need aspi functions for controlling a cdrom tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc you can add the scsiha sys driver to your config sys file e g driver c scsiha sys v windows needs the v option this driver must be loaded into low memory it cannot be loaded into high memory and it occupies about k as of november the scsiha sys driver could be obtained from the adaptec bbs at hopefully it s still there if you need aspi functions and have the aspi dos sys driver version or a you can use both the aspi dos sys and scsiha sys drivers in your config sys file e g driver c aspi dos sys driver c scsiha sys v amazingly enough the scsiha sys driver can also be loaded high assuming you have dos i would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn t i asked adaptec s technical support about this and they said that loading scsiha sys high should be fine as long as aspi dos sys is loaded low on my system not using scsiha sys with aspi dos a would occasionally cause windows to crash upon restarting or exiting windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk some of my c windows grp files would be corrupted for me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from progman exe the default windows shell and vice versa this is the reason scsiha sys may be necessary i have absolutely no idea if scsiha sys is necessary with versions of aspi dos earlier than note that many people can use aspi dos or a without scsiha sys they do not seem to have any problems at all i consider these people lucky others like me have had all sorts of problems in my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to aspi dos the scsiha sys driver is no longer needed unfortunately while you could get previous aspi dos upgrades from the adaptec bbs the aspi dos driver is not available from the adaptec bbs as far as i know there are only three ways to get a copy you can buy the new as of november adaptec ez scsi driver kit which supposedly includes aspi dos as well as other drivers such as cdrom drivers i believe the list price is around if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi dos you can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for around a copy of aspi dos is included in central point pc tools for msdos note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories note further that only aspi dos is included the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included this is where i obtained my copy of aspi dos note however that i am now getting occasional parity errors with windows in all probability defective hardware in my pc is causing this as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above solutions however because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver related for example changing the bus on off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this i ve run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers this is why the memory tests didn t find any problems the problems show up only under disk i o however i m mentioning this just in case it isn t a hardware problem floppy controller based tape backup devices there are two possible problems with using the adaptec with a floppy controller based tape backup device such as the colorado memory systems jumbo tape backups restores can take a very long time the tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my however i ve heard of other people having similar problems and so i m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my tape backups restores take a long time if you have a floppy controller based tape backup device you may have to adjust the adaptec bus on off timing for best results when using the tape drive normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause however the default bus timing on the adaptec may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds this causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to transfer data in memory to from the tape drive and the adaptec uses dma to transfer data in memory to from the hard disk the floppy dma needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data is eventually fed to it the default bus timing on the adaptec which is really dma timing is too large for example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape because the default timing on the adaptec hogs the memory too much too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive as a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough the solution is to change the adaptec s bus on off timing the default factory setting is microseconds on and microseconds off the bus on timing needs to be lowered to microseconds this can be done in one of two ways if you have aspi dos you can use the n option for example i use a bus on timing of microseconds which means that i use the following line in my config sys file device c aspi dos sys n note that there is no space between the n and the if you don t have aspi dos your only recourse is to try to find a program called setscsi exe which is very difficult to find the reason is that adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed i once asked someone who worked for adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy i believe that there are a couple of sites that have it if you do find a copy you run it like so setscsi n this adjusts the bus on timing to microseconds running setscsi exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi exe if you use aspi dos setscsi exe crashed my system if aspi dos was loaded i could use setscsi exe with scsiha sys however do not lower the bus on timing below microseconds or increase it above microseconds if you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower for me microseconds works fine this value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little once you ve lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster also do not experiment with the bus on off times with the other options that i have intentionally not described unless you know what you are doing bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh a program called bustifix exe exists on the adaptec bbs unless this has been upgraded since i last checked which has been a while this is a self extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on off times for the and others however when i tried running this program with my a my system crashed at the time i was running scsiha sys and i didn t check to see if there was a conflict with it maybe this old program works only with the b although the docs say that it works with the a erratic tape operations or too many tape errors this problem may or may not exist although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular could cause it however i ve heard of other people having similar problems and so i m mentioning this just in case it isn t a hardware problem just on my symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup tape backup works but the tape compare fails the tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much too often unlike the above mentioned problem tape backups restores take a long time where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting stopping occurs every few seconds or so fastback plus does not find see any tape backup devices other programs like central point backup and the cms jumbo software assuming that you have a cms jumbo tape drive can find see the tape drive but fastback plus cannot too many tape read errors although i do not know what is causing this problem i discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it a few months ago i upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller as i already had a floppy controller on the i initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller after a while i decided to try disabling the floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard when i did this the tape drive a cms jumbo reliability increased dramatically and fastback plus was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive i don t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my on the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the on the other hand the tape drive didn t work well attached to the floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my i did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables i don t know what the cause really is however if you re having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller sound cards many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using dma like the tape drive dma the adaptec s dma can conflict with the sound card dma unlike that of the tape dma this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error your system crashes with a parity error message what happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware i ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity e g higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using bits instead of etc like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the adaptec s bus on timing see the section on tape drives for information on how this is done note however that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity error the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem i e some software is inefficient disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this miscellaneous info this section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors much of it is merely information that i ve heard or read about and have not verified i believe that the following information is correct but i m not sure use it at your own risk with qemm and you need to specify the db parameter e g db unless you are using the aspi dos driver if you don t qemm will crash hang at bootup although the qemm manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a is present and automatically add this option to the qemm command line at least this occurred with the qemm install program i haven t tested any other version earlier versions of qemm probably need this parameter but i m not sure i ve never used a version earlier than if you use aspi dos you do not need to give qemm the db parameter some or all versions of the do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size to support hard disks with capacities over gb you need to get a new rom bios from adaptec i m not sure if this is still true of the latest bs being sold by adaptec to connect a cdrom drive to the you need a scsi cdrom drive and some drivers note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces non scsi these drives cannot be used with the you have three choices for cdrom drivers i have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information you can buy adaptec s ez scsi driver package which lists for something like if you already have older adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around contact adaptec for details the ez scsi package supposedly contains everything that you need you can buy the corelscsi driver package which is made by the same people that make coreldraw this package contains cdrom drivers scsi tape drivers worm drivers etc i do not know the list price but i ve seen this package sold for around note that corelscsi does not come with the aspi dos driver which is needed if you do not already have aspi dos you may be better off getting adaptec s ez scsi instead this method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by adaptec s ez scsi kit but i m mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers you can use the drivers in the adaptec asw kit aspi dos and the asw kit aspi cdrom drivers you will have to get a copy of mscdex exe a high level cdrom driver if it is not included in the asw kit but this is available from several bulletin boards to use a scsi tape drive with the you need software that knows how to talk to a scsi tape drive software that i ve heard about are again like the above section on cdrom drives i have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information central point pc tools for msdos supposedly supports a large number of scsi tape drives it comes with scsi drivers aspi dos as well as central point backup the corelscsi driver package contains a scsi tape backup program see the above section on cdrom drives for more details however note that corelscsi does not come with but requires aspi dos i ve seen advertisements that sell the in three configurations scsi controller with hard disk rom bios scsi controller w bios and adaptec aspi drivers scsi controller w bios adaptec aspi drivers and corelscsi drivers programs i imagine that adaptec now sells the in a fourth configuration scsi controller w bios and ez scsi drivers including aspi drivers those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar for msdos that talks to a scsi tape drive via the aspi dos driver you need this driver before you can use this program i ve never used this version of gnu tar but i ve heard that it works i don t know how well though if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet a copy can be found on wsmr simtel army mil and mirror sites pd msdos dskutl aspibin zip gnu tar for scsi tape drives adaptec xx aspipat zip patches for aspibin relative to gnu tar aspisrc zip src for gnu tar for scsi tape adaptec ctrlr i have no idea if a copy can be found on compuserve unixforum might have it if any forum does as far as msdos is concerned the a and the b controllers are the same with msdos the a should work as well as the b however the hardware for these two boards is not identical and there is at least one non msdos program that initially did not work with a a but did work with a b bsd a version of bsd unix in case

with scsi controlers scsi mb s with mb s burst bit mb s with mb s burst bit and mb s with mb s burst bit wide and fast bit scsi can be wide or fast it depends on how the port is designed the quadras will support fast scsi but not wide when the os scsi manager is rewritten since the quardas use a scsi non wide port the article in pc mag was talking about scsi scsi uses ten devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a lot like scsi devices slower through put from your own figures scsi is indeed twice esdi as the article pointed out as for faster then ide that seems to be bit scsi using a scsi contoler chip the mac quadra uses a scsi controler chip for its scsi and gets mb s through put for asynchronous bit scsi far in excess of a normal synchronous scsi output of is which is near the burst of a scsi machine with a scsi controller chip the pc world seems to have scsi and scsi mixed up fact is scsi controler chips allow near scsi speeds through a scsi device as shown in the mac quadra which skews some of the data of scsi vs ide or esdi test i agree that the article could have stated that the faster then ide came off a scsi device with a scsi chip maybe it was there and the editor killed it because the article was dealing with scsi not scsi and he did not understand the effect of a scsi device with a scsi controller chip scsi chips are limited to mb max scsi devices with scsi chips becoming common produce up to mb s in bit mode and mb s in bit mode the fast version scsi ports cannot use wide scsi of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that scsi devices have scsi chips or more accurately the machine does this allows the best of both worlds high scsi speeds and cheeper scsi costs full scsi hardware port electronic controller etc is very expensive it also creates a logistic nightmare as to how fast scsi goes when one knows the facts behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about even if it does

these scsi facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my mac ibm info sheet available by ftp on sumex aim stanford edu in the info mac report as mac ibm compare version txt it should be but may still

chip not at a mb s mb s burst it does not scsi is mb s maximum synchronous and quadra uses ansynchronous scsi which is slower it seems that mac and ibm see scsi interface and think scsi when it maybe

to dpi opinions larryhow austin ibm com wrote what are the current products available to upgrade the resolution which ones support postscript any experiences with them either good or bad is the quality difference really noticable i m planning on producing camera ready copy of homes will the higher resolution be noticed for these if you are talking about laser jet then i believe it has to be postscript i don t see any advantage to using pcl when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the lj that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job besides i don t think pcl is even capable of handling dpi specifications i only have experience with the laser master winjet which brings the lj up to dpi and it uses postscript it also has a fast print mode which is not postscript and it is at a lower resolution dpi i think but it is fast this particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript so even with a decent pc you know it s going to be slow i e slow compared to a high end workstation processed ps the quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait for the ps processing i m rather impatient we were using it for b w camera images rs the gray scale image was accepted by ms word and handed to the winjet ps printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the winjets postscript processor the postscript is rendered into ram lots of it and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer the ps processor can also accept ps files created from other sources including dos applications but windows has to be running at the time of printing the ps processor is responsible for the halftoning and i d say it does a pretty good job our camera images came out very good in my opinion not as good as laser master s demo though i don t know how many other similar products are out there but i would be surprised if there are several gordon langtandberg future domain tmc

think so much for the monitor on to the bitch session and test results in going with the modern trend the orchid p card only supports colors in x mode without a driver of course this breaks any dos program which uses svga modes like most of my cd roms the compudyne whiplash vga orchid fahrenheit and orchid f vlb all share this limitation those are all s cards which means it is an s problem for them the p uses a weitek vga chip which also doesn t support them the hercules graphite card does seem to have these modes but i didn t run the same test cases as i did on the other boards during the brief time i had it it was able to print the splash screen for the grolier s encyclopedia though which the s cards just printed as hash which is why i suspect the svga modes are supported the supported resolutions really annoy me you can do x at hz if you tell the driver you have an nec fg they only have about six monitors listed plus generic and if you choose generic you can t get any high refreshes at all but at x you are limited to hz seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do hz at it sure should be able to do it at higher vertical

orchid and with the drivers i don t know what i have he was unable to recreate the problem on the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn t have the problem he didn t know why they limited the refresh to hz either the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules speedy program this program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels second i don t have the numbers for the graphite card but they were close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that was running in a mhz isa so the numbers aren t really comparable the following numbers were all obtained using a mhz air motherboard umc chipset with mb memory i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit k means thousand not m means million pixels per second orchid fahrenheit vlb orchid p chip s weitek dib to screen k k k k memory to screen m m m m screen to

face and transfers it to the screen i have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go the memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display the screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen awesome interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie filled with cross hatching and ternary rops whatever they are graphics operations like xors maybe are a dead loss on the i give two numbers for the fonts because i think they are caching when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly the speed of the ofvlb then the speed increases dramatically sounds like

interface can i read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion via polling and that isn t platform or clockspeed specific the joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port how you send a command to the port to read it then you time how long it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit this time is proportional to the joystick position obviously since time is used as a position

two hds are supposed to have didn t know pcs were into s m and i think i configured the jumpers properly the mb one is the master the new mb one is the slave the only thing i can think of is maybe i m doing the cabling wrong i ve tried several combinations controller master slave controller slave master master controller slave none of them worked unfortunately i can t think of any others another possibility is that the mb one is already partitioned into two seperate drives c and d and the cmos asks for c drive and d drive setup info rather than drive and drive like most others i ve seen could this be confusing things so i need help the drive came bereft of any docs except for some info for the cmos setup the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card i

scsi is twice as fasst as esdi faster than ide and support up to devices its acceptance has long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches i love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re performance where do they get those numbers i ll list the actual performance ranges which should convince anyone that such a statement is absurd scsi i ranges from mb s scsi ii ranges from mb s ide ranges from mb s esdi is always mb s although there are some non standard versions by your own data the although scsi is twice as fast as esdi is correct how is twice do you just pick whatever scsi setup that makes the statment correct even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless you understood that esdi and ide i include scsi and ata are completely different esdi is device level like mfm rll with a scsi controller chip scsi can reach mb s which is indeed faster than ide of is all these scsi facts have been great you can compare two numbers ata has several speed modes by the way but what the article said was misleading wrong posted to this newsgroup in my mac ibm info sheet available by ftp on sumex aim stanford edu in the info

mb s mb s burst it does not scsi is mb s maximum synchronous and quadra uses ansynchronous scsi which is slower it seems that mac and ibm see something is missing there anyway i agree there s a lot of

article apr julian uwo ca wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca wayne smith writes in article ercc h w netcom com erc netcom com eric smith writes scsi is better because it has a better future and it has a lot of minor advantages right now ide cards are cheaper right now but will be obsolete in a few years in fact ide cards are so cheap they might as well be free the real cost is in the ide drives scsi cards cost more but they are worth it i almost got a hernia laughing at this one you ll probably get one when you realize that your vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks if anything scsi on a pc will be obsolete killed off by vesa local with any luck pc bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bus it actually slows down your system bus ide it must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a scsi drive then pay another for a scsi controller maybe my workstation doesn t understand what your vesa local bus ide is vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi whatever intels spec is vlbus it not good for much more than vga cards to each his own i ll laugh when you start crying over how much you spent for your little ide drives and then finding out you need more space the biggest advantage of scsi right now is that you can add more different kinds of devices such as tapes etc easily and can add bigger disks the best and most cost effective hard disks available are scsi here here only of you need drives larger then meg oh yes gotta have megs sec transfer rate for those speedy tape backups and cd rom drives don t stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know nothing about i d rather wait a second compared to the minutes and ide would take obviously exaggerated have you ever tried to backup gigs of disk oh i forgot you can t because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big basically if a person has to ask which one is better for him her then they will probably never see the expensive benefits from scsi i guess you probably bought a sx too also all this arm waving about scsi expandability is a moot point if the user only has one or two drives on it and with scsi those two drives may be fast but that speed is only due to the onboard memory cache something i can duplicate with a caching ide controller what the scsi fast wide spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide crap stop this thread now its just cluttering up bandwidth if you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive the best scsi fast wide etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive all the response given are based upon personal experience with or drives you can t judge such completely different

the best way to approach this it is somewhat frustrating i got it to work somehow but my turbo switch doesn t work at all i just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions my cents worth the speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker a speaker being a coil it s bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach turbo switch there are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active with the switch pushed in or the switch out i think the middle wire is common use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in and which two wires are connected when the switch is out place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard led s turbo and hd led s are uni directional depending which way the wires are attached the led will not light on my ami motherboard if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board the board will power up in default in turbo mode if your motherboard is like that just attace the led wires to the board if the led doesn t light power off reverse the connectors and try again it should work if it does

when it comes to multi tasking data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster does it have a better cache system i thought scsi was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached if we are only talking about a single drive explain why scsi is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive ide integrated device electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mb s max why don t you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you re blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what s the point who said isa was necessary eisa or vlb are the only interfaces worth investing thousands of dollars e g a new pc s worth of money in who says ide is limited to megs sec what about vlb ide does anyone know how they perform you didn t read to carefully vlb ide uses the same connection mechanism as standard ide if transfer rate is limited by ide whether it s interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matters not so at its lowest setting scsi interface in asynchronous scsi mode averages the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode in full scsi mode it blows poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can as implimented on what system on mine for one thing scsi blows ide out of the water hands down if ide has better throughput why isn t it used on workstations and file servers the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi comes from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the scsi through put given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what does a meg megs sec scsi drive cost no that s the nice thing on a multitasking os scsi can use both drives at once i ve got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time it s pretty ugly i just bought at quantum for my mac at home i paid for it i haven t seen ide drives cheaper the original cga cart back in was i think the original ega card or pga was scsi has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price mainly because we re talking about pc s and not sun s or sparc or sgi or name your favorite unix workstation that is after millions of pc buying decisions over the years scsi has had plenty of time to come down in price no actually we re talking about scsi being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the pc if they had a common read easily implemented method of adding scsi to a pc like as in a sun or mac then you d find scsi the connection medium of choice i won t argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi tasking os s when managing data from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi is more expensive but you bought your pc for expandibility so you d want to add more drives or whatever the following are why i find scsi intrinsically better than ide a partial list you can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently a scsi device works on many different machines i have a mac and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice with scsi hook them up and away they go scsi devices work together better than ide devices for instance recently i added an older connor meg ide to a maxtor meg ide the connor must be setup as the slave it will work no other way on scsi you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes i have a problem with ide s mutual exclusion i notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c to d on a scsi system under a multitasking os this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once one neat thing that i ve noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a scsi system with little problem we ve got a bunch of almost dead meg drives that i ve added to my pc i ve now got the interface full but it does allow me to have meg drives meg drive tape drive and meg drive all on the same card simply

carefully vlb ide uses the same connection mechanism as standard ide if transfer rate is limited by ide whether it s interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matters not i get different transfer rates out of my ide when i change my isa bus speed on mine for one thing scsi blows ide out of the water hands down if ide has better throughput why isn t it used on workstations and file servers ide is just a variant of the old ibm mfm at controller at least that s how it looks from a software point of view it was never meant to be an all encompassing protocal standard to be implimented across different platforms is there any argument that ide can or can t transfer data from the ide drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data are scsi versions of ide drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their scsi interface because of a higher rpm platter different arrangement of heads etc given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it

that but when the cpu wants data from both drives data to be stored in main memory are you saying that scsi can grab data from both drives at the same time and store transfer that data to main memory

find scsi the connection medium of choice so you re saying that scsi would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of pc s don t have cd rom drives or tape backups or etc that most pc s only have or had hard drive and run dos that scsi hard drives cost a lot more than mfm or rll drives at the time and how common were scsi drives under megs to years ago there s a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented scsi from becoming the connection medium of choice i won t argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi tasking os s when managing data from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi is more expensive but on that point is it faster this is what all this is about do you get more performance for the money for all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardless of the os will the scsi choice really give them more performance than ide but you bought your pc for expandibility so you d want to add more drives or whatever true but expandibility can also start on the bus which means the option is there for cd rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards you can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently no argument this is always held up to the first time scsi buyer as the best reason but how many scsi devices will the first time scsi buyer eventually acquire again does it make sense to go scsi for a single hard drive system a scsi device works on many different machines i have a mac and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice with scsi hook them up and away they go with all the postings on the scsi i or ii specs are you really sure that pc and apple scsi hard drives are compatible and even if they are is the data accessible from either machine ie are there no formatting partitioning or

anyone tell me if this card works with the march os beta i believe so since the buslogic cards have proven to be very reliable in os the buslogic cards have an os driver that does work with the march beta support for the buslogic cards is not included with os any longer if you wish to install the beta from the cd rom you will need to rem out the adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic cards when os attempts to use them thanks adaptec so you add the buslogic drivers to the config sys on the cd rom boot disk and rem out the adaptec drivers then you install the whole st half of the beta and it won t work ibm nicely copies in the adaptec drivers once again thanks ibm so rem out the adaptec drivers once more and reboot if you have everything in the right order it will work things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation except os will try to install the adaptec scsi drivers once again at the end so you are off to more rem statements and more fun the bt bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the adaptec cards that do not come with drivers the dos drivers work great this card can easily be configured to work with different sets of i o ports and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine if you get a new card it will also be able to support up to gb drives under dos hope this helps dan dan galpin galpin cats ucsc edudata

meg sec transfer on his does your figure include a few hundred for scsi drivers to which i correctly pointed out the following since the mac uses only scsi for hard drives yes the figure includes a hundred for scsi drivers this is sloppy people and dumb as i said this is sloppy and dumb you should resounded by discounting the mac not giving maxtor meg ide drive for example by giving an example you give the implied consent that for mac info to be included in the scsi discusion ok once again with the scsi spec list why the spec list again we are talking scsi on a pc not on a mac or a unix box and we are talking isa bus or possibly eisa or vlb ok i will do this v e r y s l o w l y so you can understand reguardless of whether it is a mac or a pc scsi and scsi are different from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous scsi all of these have different speeds and costs lumping them all together as scsi is dumb and sloppy take again the quote later on as an example of the problem in the pc world the spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were coming from in the article it shows the article is correct in it staments about scsi but not consitant this isin t comp periphs scsi

who report it like you look at the inconsitant use of scsi in the below quote my comments in although scsi is twice as fast as esdi this is asynchronous scsi with a scsi chip faster than ide this is both asynchronous scsi with a scsi chip and bit scsi pc magazine april the article is confused not scsi the term is a mess from inconsitant use not because the interface itself is a mess scsi means the set of scsi interfaces composed of scsi and scsi not scsi as some people want to use it to read consitantly the quote should read asynchronous scsi with a scsi chip although asynchronous scsi is twice as fast as esdi one third the speed of ide or asynchronous scsi with a scsi chip or bit scsi although scsi with a scsi chip and bit scsi are eight times as fast as esdi faster than ide note the

appreciated richard randall ez hamlet ucdavis edu there is a way in which a multi tasking computer actually gives you more cpu power then you had before and that is with i o overlap with i o overlap your cpu can continue to think while disk operations are underway whereas without overlap your cpu sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish and disk operations take an eternity compared to a fast cpu so when you ve got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do one way is with dma or bus mastering either of these make it possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the cpu the alternative is for the cpu to move the data there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and bus mastering ide however is defined by the standard at interface created for the ibm pc at which requires the cpu to move all the data bytes with no dma richard krehbiel richk grebyn com os will do for me until

of view why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi tasking data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster does it have a better cache system i thought scsi was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached if we are only talking about a single drive explain why scsi is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive the adaptec series use bus mastering this means that the cpu doesn t sit waiting for data bytes it can go off and do other computing if you have an advanced multi tasking os that is dos just sits and waits anyway ide integrated device electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mb s max why don t you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you re blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what s the point who says ide is limited to megs sec what about vlb ide does anyone know how they perform why don t you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first ide was designed to plug into isa

mike schwartz michael b smith writes but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi tasking os s when managing data from a single scsi hard drive a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory ide also uses dma techniques i believe floppy controller also uses dma and most a d boards also use dma dma is no big deal and has nothing to do directly with scsi ide does not do dma this is because it s like te pc at hard disk interface the controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card then the cpu moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it s needed if ide doesn t work this way then it s not compatible heck if ide used dma then you d hear all kinds of complaints about isa bus systems with more than m ram not working with their ide drives m is the dma addressing limit of the isa bus and if ide did dma there would be trouble btw there are dma enabling signals in the ide cable spec but the last report i heard was that they are never implemented because it would require a

thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail there seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx f one article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec that figure for image rotation would seem to be a little high on my nec fg the specs call for no greater than mm well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has a very noticable barrel distortion it s not dramatic but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn t fill the entire screen the fact that it is worse on the right side doesn t help matters what i m trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect i don t want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment i can t speak for mag innovision but as far as nec is concerned they are adjusted to factory spec before leaving the central usa distribution point ma for the eastern canadian market now here s the key nec knows that the monitors adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances with all the bumps rough handling and such and therefore expect and at least in theory require that the local distributor not dealer have it adjusted at the local service centre bull hn information systems in toronto before sale this is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my case quite are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections i for one was not willing to accept what i considered a substandard monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with nec finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor not perfect imho but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was normal the short answer is no don t accept these imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors one has a right to expect higher quality and if you re

stuff about the connection between ide and ida deleated mhz clock bit width mb sec if ide speed come from ida where does the mb s sighted for ide come from scsi is not complex it is just the way the industry uses and talks about it there are three key differences in scsi the controller chip the port and the software that is it let us look as scsi in from this stand point scsi asynchronous and synchronous modes software scsi driver only asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode only mb s vs mb s synchronous speeds can be reached by most scsi divices with a rewrite of the software driver as is the case for the mac quadra scsi bit this is the main source for the confusion this differs from scsi only in the controler chip in most machines in the mac and some pcs this is called fast scsi because it uses scsi ports and software drivers and can produce scsi speeds through scsi inspite of this even in the slower asynchronous mode average speed in asynchronous scsi mode mb s with mb s see in both quadras and higher end pcs synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate mb s scsi bit two versions wide fast wide scsi requires two things over bit scsi a scsi software driver and a wide scsi port on the machine and the external device fast scsi also requires two things over bit scsi scsi driver software and that the recieving devise support bit fast scsi speed of both is the same mb s with mb s burst scsi bit also know as wide and fast scsi over bit scsi this requires scsi driver software wide scsi port and that the recieving devices also have a bit mode scsi chip as expected this is very expencive speed mb s with mb s bursts as i said simple seven versions of scsi seperated by software the controler chip and the port standarize the software and it drops to only five versions of scsi seperate by only hardware the chip and the portconner cp f info please i am looking for information about this drive switch settings geometry etc conner cp f please reply via e mail

recommendations on which to buy i have heard that logitech makes the best and manufactures dexxa scanners but which one is the best buy would dpi really be helpful output would be no better than hp laserjet iii or canon bj x to x i am leaning toward the mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices which should i buy if you have a hand scanner please let me

year for the may issue of windows i reviewed several monitors including the nanao t i there s no question that the nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last year the difference between my ranking of the best in windows and the ranking in windows sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring i used different tests than they did and i scored differently there s nothing wrong with the mitsubishi and it scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect incidentally one of the things everyone should do when they re reading reviews of any product whether it s monitors or mice is to read the criteria and methodology carefully unless you know how the product testing was done and on what the scores are based you can t possibly know what they really mean just seeing that i rank a monitor differently from windows sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking likewise it s impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing after all some of what we do may not apply to you likewise some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another

have a tape drive or cd rom any help would be appreciated so when you ve got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do one way is with dma or bus mastering either of these make it possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the cpu the alternative is for the cpu to move the data there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and bus mastering how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus ide however is defined by the standard at interface created for the ibm pc at which requires the cpu to move all the data bytes with no dma if we re talking isa at bus here then you can only have dma channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device so even though you can have at least devices on a scsi bus explain how all of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card to the isa at bus at the same time also i m still trying to track down a copy of ibm s at reference book but from their pc technical manual page the fdd adapter is buffered on the i o bus and uses the system board direct memory access dma for record data transfers i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at hdd controller doesn t that makes real sensere ide vs scsi in article apr grebyn com

berkeley edu bing ho writes i read about the development of eisa some time ago but dismissed it in light of the intense interest in vesa and pci however i recently was disheartened to hear that isa cannot address more than mb of ram a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon i recall that eisa will support bit transfer among other enhancements is there such a standard being developed very possibly but if it s still going to be backwards compatible with the isa bus it s going to be the same tripe that the current eisa implementation really is from what i ve seen the pci bus will just be

dimension and i am thinking about upgrade it to a or the station has a power supply two floppy disk drives and the big case i have sony monitor syquest drive mac and maybe a cd rom reader mac for it here are the questions i have so far is there a motherboard at this dimension that i could use the case the original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed can i use them to control these devices under how much do i have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won t work how can i make syquest scsi and cd rom scsi work on this station i heard that there is a cheap sound board that has scsi controller built in what s quality of this board how much usually does a scsi control cost is there any ftp sites that has syquest driver or cd rom driver for the pc if i can have everything hooked up ok what i want is a motherboard a sound board to make it a mpc quality station how much would it cost to do that is it worth the hussle than just buy a new station btw i need to buy a keyboard for it too any input is welcome thank you peter liure date is stuck in article apr kosman uucp kevin kosman uucp kevin o gorman writes anybody seen the date get stuck i m running ms

every morning this involves exiting the menu system to get to dos anyone have the slightest idea why this should be even a clue as to whether the hardware battery cmos or dos is broken i bet it suddenly started sticking when you started leaving the pc running the menu all night there is a limitation bug in the date roll over software in pc s that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a dos call rather than a bios call as menus often use otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called somebody might be able to correct the

prepare to hotfix the one internal drive install will proceed successfully but when i try to boot the server it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware internal examination indicates that the keycard is present and there is one disk drive or at least one large single unit attempts to configure a second drive in cmos result in drive not ready errors questions the software is netware level ii and i can see burnt on to the screen sft netware level ii v a however to configure netware for level ii mirrored or duplexed disks requires a second disk yes so how is the novell server a normally configured can i install sft netware level ii v a as level i or is this what is causing my serialisation error is the novell server a normally equipped with two hard drives one of which has failed would this mean i can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive what else can cause a serialisation error what happens

don t use the motherboards on board dma which is much slower isa has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in isa system try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or crash i forget their are dma channels in an isa system are bit are bit the system uses dma a soundblaster uses dma i could buy a busmastering xga video card a busmastering scsi ha in order for them to work properly i would have to find out what dma channel the xga card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to use a different dma channel for its dma xfers i don t know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa i m not sure if they can on eisa systems either i do know that on eisa mca systems you can allow bm cards to use the same dma channel thanksre soundblaster irq and port settings they don t have a conflict because technically lpt does not use irq the parallel printer processor the actual number escapes me contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as irq then onto the main processor as int x f by default the parallel printer processor does not enable it s interrupt line therefore no int x f s will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual irq note this applies to com ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although com s software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring com port activity easier than polling the serial uart thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused windows may be a different storymodems and noisy lines hi i just got a problem i have a cheapo bps modem which i use to connect to my university but i get too much garbage on the screen i do know it s because the

u c camelot bradley edu joe zbiciak writes what s the word on the chipset is this a rom bug specific to a specific brand using the rockwell or is it the rockwell chipset itself there were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much expected with any fax modem talking with a different fax or modem which may have also been revised or is new i m pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems so you ll have to get it from someone else someone else could you please comment on that i have just bought a twincom dfi which has a rockwell chipset it wasn t cheap so i would like to hear of problems i m likely to run into however i can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the rockwell mpu as opposed to the dpu for an internal implementation this is because the mpu used speed buffering instead of having a interface without the interface the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions like in windows as far as i know the speed buffering works ok for external modems if a is used on the internal serial port board phew i was lucky the twincom internal version has a a and one of the rockwell chips is marked rc dp but still i would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware problems nielshelp can somone explain to me all the stuff about modems like v v hst usrobotics why cheap can t cannot

you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bus it actually slows down your system bus ide it must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a scsi drive then pay another for a scsi controller yeah there is absolutely no use for vlb except for video graphics and no ide could possibly take advantage the vlb because it runs at mhz and bits do people forget that the ide was specifically designed to interface directly with the at isa bus we ve seen ides come out for eisa xt isa and now even mca but at all times it was a bit standard running at somewhere near mhz when you run an ide off of the vlb there s no way that you re running it at mhz it would burn up of course same goes for scsi esdi whatever none of them run at cpu speed the only way to gain advantage with a vlb ide is to hook it up to a caching controller i suspect it would be much much better to get a software disk cache instead since you get write caching as well because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big i ve seen some fuji ide drives going as high as g yousuf khancan t get x to work w m ati ultra pro i am unable to get my gateway dx to run windows

am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his dtk i o plus ii card working and it does not want to cooperate the documentation is no help at all as an example it says the serial port can be changed to com from com by moving jumpers but does not say what jumpers to move there are banks of jumpers the first one is labeled as follows c c s p p g the second bank is labeled irq and has the following labels c s s c s i have determined that the c c jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as com or com the p p jumpers tell it to use the printer port as lpt or lpt i am guessing that the g enables the game port and the s should enable the second serial port but i can t get it to work i have tried numerous setting on the irq bank without success i assume that this bank must tell the card which irq s to use for both ports but i don t know how any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ebd elliot dierksen is that a real poncho i mean is that a mexican poncho or

master slave relationship that two hds are supposed to have didn t know pcs were into s m and i think i configured the jumpers properly the mb one is the master the new mb one is the slave the only thing i can think of is maybe i m doing the cabling wrong i ve tried several combinations controller master slave controller slave master master controller slave none of them worked unfortunately i

device mouse sys in config sys the only difference is the time the driver gets loaded mouse sys will be loaded during the config sys and therefor before the command com mouse com will be loaded during

the working of both drivers is totally the same when i ran dos i preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec bat because some programs won t run with some drivers and i could choose the ones i

is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader stacker superstor pro is not considered since it is slower than stacker although just as reliable byte magazine s conclusion so it s hard to make any decision to go with stacker or with doubledisk gold v however it seems that at it is quite a buy buddy christyono buddy optics ece wisc edu summary of replies hello buddy i do not have dd gold experience i just ordered it i currently have dd the last version i am very pleased with its performance here is my suggestion if you do not have any compression software currently i would go with dos s compression all the discussion on the net indicates that for you get the compression built into the os plus the other utilities that you would pay way more than for besides you are now at dos whatever that means if you have doubledisk already like i do the cost is for the upgrade after thinking about it and asking the net i decided that i could not go wrong with the update cost i have never suffered from performance of dd i have a ms hd with large sw packages in both compressed and uncompressed format it works great not delays i think the a is better than b arguements are a lot of bunk they are all comparable in performance i am looking forward to being able to loadhigh the dd sw that has been an annoyance if you have stacker et al currently i would not see it worth the effort to upgrade just my regards mark bagdy buddy i got the same mailer about weeks ago i got ddg and installed it the documentation was in my opinion easy to follow i used the automatic installation not the custom and everything went smoothly there were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with max qemm ddg has an uninstall unlike dos if you need it my system has a mb hard drive before installing ddg i had mb free after ddg i had mb free pretty good statistics considering that my mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion along with other drivers

gold for a little more than a month on a dx mhz mb seagate drive running dos windows in enhanced mode i ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a doubledisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache i have no complaints about reliability it was very easy to install the only problem i had was with castle wolfenstein d i assumed the game was trying to bypass dos disk access and moved the game to the non compressed region of the disk since then the game has never given me a problem there was never any damage to the doubledisk drive compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around this is lower than expected but about size of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files if you have any more specific questions

only minor hassles this one works fine i haven t noticed any problems in any of my applications i also ordered it because of all the complaints about the ati a few months ago guess you can choose either buggy state of the art stuff or robust average stuff for my particular configuration tower watt supply pkg no monitor viper etc the zeos was slightly cheaper than gateway austin etc but this

in x mode without a driver of course this breaks any dos program which uses svga modes like most of my cd roms this is not the case the rom on the p supports vesa modes of up to x in colors vesa compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes but i m forwarding your posting to our software group just in case can t be too careful not that i doubt that your applications are failing to run lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact svga they re looking at and don t use vesa calls vesa is still pretty new every new chip set confuses them the supported resolutions really annoy me you can do x at hz if you tell the driver you have an nec fg they only have about six monitors listed plus generic and if you choose generic you can t get any high refreshes at all but at x you are limited to hz seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do hz at it sure should be able to do it at higher vertical resolution was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have and it will do x x hz as well i think we go to at least hz at x x and maybe more and it s a function of the ramdac speed not the power we need to fix the problems you ve noted they were already on the list if you re really interested though take a look at the text file p res dat which holds the data from which the choices in the p monitor installation program are built working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors keep a backup copy of the file once you ve built a new version of the p res dat file run the p installation program inst and your new choices should show up this assumes you have the weitek v drivers you can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver is version microsoft uses this gimmick too the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules speedy program this program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels second i don t have the numbers for the graphite card but they were close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that was running in a mhz isa so the numbers aren t really comparable the following numbers were all obtained using a mhz air motherboard umc chipset with mb memory i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit the speedy benchmark was put out by hercules and iit who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the hercules graphite iit agx card look really good so i d take the numbers with a ton of salt texas instruments did the same thing with wintach trying to make the look good compared to the as if anyone cared it s safer though not safe to use benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists etc interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie filled with cross hatching and ternary rops whatever they are graphics operations like xors maybe are a dead loss on the i think you ll a large discrepancy between the results of speedy and the results of anything else in the universe on these things i give two numbers for the fonts because i think they are caching when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly the speed of the ofvlb then the speed increases dramatically sounds like programming to a benchmark to me font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization windows has hooks for it built right into the gdi what s kind of silly is iit s use of a hardwired the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver not only is it useless in real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the bart simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most recently drawn string in off screen memory and just do a screen to screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row we call it the bart simpson optimization because bart s the only person we can see benefiting from it he could right i will not cheat on benchmarks a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all its just what i saw when i ran them on my computer i normally don t write disclaimers but this time maybe i d better my testing is totally unconnected with my work i program under unix on decstations is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my company we don t

smith writes stuff deleted so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at hdd controller doesn t that makes real sense actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to memory with a rep insw or whatever the instruction is called is quite efficient single instruction goes as fast as the controller cpu know how to use the bus since the wasn t cached the bus is likely a critical resource relative to cpu performance and it s possible that dma bus interference would cause as much or more loss of cpu cycles for computing as does the rep insw sequence the floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the cpu for floppy data transfer as was done on the pc jr by the way really does stink

something like a clock has to make a get date system call apparently the clock hardware interrupt and bios don t do this date advance automatically the get date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then then advances the date anybody with more info there are two problems the bios tod routine which updates the bios clock uses only bit for day increment so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the bios to read the clock in the meantime and the bios resets the day wrap indicator on the first get date call from anybody after the wrap indicator has been set so unless the first bios get date call after midnight is done by the dos kernel which is the only part of dos which knows how to increment the date the day wrap indication is normally lost my guess is that kevin s menu system uses bios calls to read the clock in order to display the time and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost even if the menu system notices the day wrap which i think is indicated by a non zero value in al there really isn t any particularly good way to tell dos about it so that dos can update the day the menu system should use dos calls to get the time which would cause the dos kernel to do the bios call and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly possibly though the menu system can t easily use dos calls for time because dos is not reentrant and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the menu system is inside some other dos call wally bassre amd i clones now legal in us poe wharton upenn edu

single dual drive and led operation on the drive need to be set as described in the relevant product specification i a single drive environment the drive is described as a master in a dual drive environment the drives are described as a master and a slave this is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics there are four links lk lk lk and lk adjacent to the way interface connector they have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the way interface connector lk led when fitted this jumper connects the led drive to pin of the interface this allows a led to be connected to the interface an external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the led when this option is selected the value of the resistor will be dependant on the led type chosen but will be in the range of ohms ot ohms lk dual drives this jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus it fallows communication across the way interface connector indicating to the master drive the presence of a slave lk master when fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a master if there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way lk iochrdy when fitted this connects the iochrdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i e greater than mbytes per second when using interleave this jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than mbytes per second there are four possible master slave configurations in which a drive s may be jumpered master single drive with led on interface lk lk fitted master single drive without led on interface lk only fitted master dual drive without led on interface lk lk fitted slave dual drive without led on interface no jumpers fitted master dual drive with led on interface lk lk lk fitted slave dual drive with led on interface lk only fitted the master drive will delay power up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used the other connections for a led will be found close to the way connector at the other end of the drive this led driver is not affected by the link options an internal current

arithmetic receiver transmitter normally the older boards have a or uart on board those chips generate an irq for every char they received the uart has an internal byte buffer so with the right software installed it generates an irq every chars what does it do for high speed modems is it necessary for k or higher throughput if you ran dos you don t need a because dos runs only one task at a time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer but if you are running a multitasking os such as os unix etc windows the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task the result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts is it only for internal modems no the only diffrence is that internal modems have the uart on board whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the uart on board if you have any experience with or higher speed modems please let me know what you think also any particular brand name reccomended or will a

itself and pin on the ide card but for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between

of air from the fan hot spots may develop on my motherboard or elsewhere my g k has intake air vents in the front of the enclosure right at mb level these vents would be removed along with the top cover in this scenario rendering airflow from the fan pretty useless however short periods in this mode don t seem to heat things up too much but my conclusions are far from scientific tim i ran a out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no major effects yeah no case at all mb sitting on a static bag other than the noise from the poersupply it ran pretty good as for cooling problems i
