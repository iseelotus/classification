drive and am running smartdrv the version that comes with windows on it i rarely use windows i use a program called disk technician gold v to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive it works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file or if there is anything else is wrong with it and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting my hard drive is notorious for bad sectors i usually end up with new bad sectors a week here s what happened i ran a program and dtg broke in with an emergency warning and recommended i reboot it gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded i exited the program and did just this dtg went through its bootup process examining for new errors etc and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time i then went back to the program executed it again and the exact same error was detected i rebooted and tried again and the same error happened again so i removed dtg from memory and went to the program to see if i could detect anything wrong sure enough there was a number of read attempts so i rebooted and reloaded dtg but removed the cache i executed the program no read errors either audible or detected by dtg i quit the program loaded the cache and ran the program again the errors were detected ok so the errors are there and dtg detects but doesn t fix them when the cache is loaded when the cache is not loaded there are no errors so to see if the cache was interfering with any other files i went into xtree gold and tagged all files and searched them for a random string in other words i wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive before i got through the c s dtg had detected at least six errors and recommended i reboot does anybody have any idea why smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive oh there are exactly two misreads per file and in about every files are affected i originally posted this message to disk

with atm be sure to upgrade to which replaces who knows how old is is as fast as tt and if you disable the small screen fonts atm does better screen rendering at the smaller point sizes not true both type and tt fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size it all depends on the font s maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed probably the reason for your opinion experience that tt is inferior is because most tt fonts on the market today have been converted from type outlines to tt either by the font vendor or end users using fontographer or fontmonger instead of the tt fonts being hand hinted to take advantage of the tt hinting language at best these converted tt fonts will be on a par with the type font of its orgin truetype is a much richer and more robust hinting language than type the hinting of diagonals for instance which tt does and type cannot if you check out the windows core fonts times arial courier symbol wingdings you ll see what can be done with tt there are other fonts out there that have been hand hinted and not just converted some of the microsoft tt font pack fonts are hinted very well you can use both tt and atm fonts at the same time if you like atm type fonts tend to be of higher quality and be more complete in terms of foreign characters again not true the characters in a

edu writes stuff del d for bandwidth s sake why sigh if you don t have more than mbs of memory using a ramdrive with windows is a waste of memory windows will access upto mb ram better as memory as to why what you did didn t work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the group pif ini files all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e however if you wanted to copy an application up to the ramdrive and re setup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless you ve got more than mbs of ram and are using whats above as the ramdrive i personally have mb s of ram and run a mb ramdrive with a great deal of success however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things i ve noted that work the best are a graphics accellerator card a co processor even an emulator helps some other disk cache besides smartdrive i ve tried several and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major headaches as well i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup it s like it s trying to it s bit in wearing the damn drive out i estimate it s only reading a mb of programs data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed what is it that

standard roman encoding on the mac no difference there between t and tt and as for fonts with thousands of glyphs right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing reason is that a font

typealign does some things that trueeffects does not including some things you apparently want if you want to use it you best not want to use it with an atm type font oh yeah lest you think this is a really cool program none of the effects are scalable like the brick background pattern is the same size whether your font is point of point and it is not extensible i e you can not add pattern of your

printing problem tom belmonte x tbelmont feds prime com wrote hello i recently tried to print some envelopes using amipro with my deskjet printer and i seem to be having a problem what happens is after i physically load the envelope into the printer per the user manual and then select the print envelope icon from amipro all of the proper options have been selected the printer just spits out the envelope without any printing of either a return address or the selected mailing address at this point the printer s online light begins to flash and the print manager shows the printer job as busy this is all that happens until i either shut the printer off or cancel the printing job from the print manager i have also tried this without the use of the print manager with similar results amipro shows the printer as being busy so does anybody have any idea solution regarding this problem i appreciate the help thanks yes ignore the manual just insert the evelope don t use the keypad to move it up the windows driver sends a message to the printer that tells it to load the envelope if it is already loaded it gets ejected and the printer tries to load another the instructions in the manual are for dumb dos apps that don t send the load envelople message tom belmonte bob taylor hp vancouverre winbench help graphics comparison in article pqd hinnbmi zephyr grace cri nz srg sir grv

winbench as a test they may want to read everything steve gibson has said on the subject in his infoworld column the past couple of month in short virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the winbench suite so the winbench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks in the last pc magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators and admitted that many of them cheated on winbench interestingly they allowed one type of cheating behaviour caching for bitblt operations no matter how unreal yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used at least one card was eliminated from the editor s choice because of

equations if the equation extends past a certain point on a line the whole thing disappears if i then try to delete the equation or cursor beyond the equation ami goes nuts the line counter at the bottom of the screen increments repeatedly and the only way out is to ctrl atl del if i have been unfortunate enough to save a document with one of these screwed up equations the document is basically trashed although i have been able to fix them by going into an ascii editor and deleteing large chunks of the document has anyone else experienced this does lotus know about it and or have a patch thanks in advance kurt nagel fido colorado edu i contacted lotus about this problem today it has been reported previously and there is a fix apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame the work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding tab and use space to align the frame or use set frame where placed w no text wrap around unforutnately once the page run on has occured you are hosed so the moral of the story is use only space characters to align equation frames hope this helps

com irq the usual place and it still did not like it simply windows seems to only support mice on com or com the funny part is though that microsoft s own mouse driver xx was quite happy with my mouse sitting on com why can t windows use the mouse driver or at least support com com irq com irq com irq maxcomport i ve tried this too actually i wanted to be able to use my second modem com irq from windows it still will not talk to that modem i created two profiles amstrad for my amstrad modem on com irq and maestro for my maestro on com irq it will not talk to the maestro at all that their driver does not support com and com in windows their suggestion was that the microsoft or ps setting in windows setup would work it does not nor here windows i can not believe that it is not possible at worst you would need a special version of a mouse driver that looked at com and com instead of com and com i know that irq and irq are normally printer port irqs but i i ve seen nothing like that i ve experimented with logitech s mouse driver too with no sucess have no printers attached a side note is that i would really like to assign com to some higher irq because my soundblaster board uses irq right now i m not using com but no modem that i know of allows settings other than irqs and if you have a soundblaster pro it should support irq as well finally a board that supports irqs the only

reading through the dos book it states that the windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive to make things compatable i removed my permanent swap file before starting the upgrade however when all the dust settled and i go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the windows directory my question is how come the temporary swap files works ok with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesn t you might want to look in windows faq for this one but here is my best explanation but i can t guarantee that i m not way off base the permenant swap file is read written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that windows creates a file called spart par in your windows directory that points to that file it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file compressed disks are actually logical disks these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used i e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space i don t know if it does or doesn t but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dos tsr s disk compression and bios in order to be access i e never use a temporary swap file never more on permenent swap files i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size windows will only use the size suggested do you wan t to create this swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers they also said that under absolutely no circumstances none will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size well that s what he said i call bull if this is true why does

framework i have come across a few that look good zapp from inmark zinc from zinc software c views from liant win from blaise some considerations i m using being new to windows programming i m from the unix x world the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important however since i m not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one i don t believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the sake of changing the api are valuable since we will be developing for the bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows api are less important we will probably buy another c class library something like tools h or booch components from rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff allocators etc so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media i was wondering if anyone had any first hand experience with any of these toolkits especially zapp and zinc a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are zapp seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes has new fancy d style controls available and support for custom controls has a windows nt version essential redirectable graphics display output architecture useful for printing sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system zinc has a platform independent resource strategy not too important for me right now comes with a interface builder tool has a windows nt version essential seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a dos version had a better demo both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff any thoughts anyone has on this would be much

permenent swap files i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size windows will only use the size suggested do you wan t to create this swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers they also said that under absolutely no circumstances none will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size well that s what he said i call bull if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it s not going to use it any takers james well someone at microsoft told you wrong windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size last summer i went to a microsoft windows technical workshop and they distributed a lot of information that the general public might not be aware of anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on creating larger than recommended swapfile i ll quote the information if you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size you will receive a message telling you that windows will not use anything larger than the recommended size this error message is incorrect we will allow the use of the larger swapfile up to four times the amount of ram on your machine so as you see microsoft does know that the information is incorrect you probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew be that what it may i would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these technical workshops they aren t actually incredibly in depth but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know besides that they offer you huge discounts on software if i remember correctly you could pick up word excel or whatever their presentation program is for that is the full blown version not an upgrade or educational

problem keeping up with the modem he has a modem on a mhz machine i can t see it having trouble keeping up his pcplus for dos works great re what to do after the high speed modem arrives edition apr this article applies only to windows and and not to nt os or dos apps not running under windows one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs c serial com performance is seriously deficient almost everyone who purchases a high speed modem v bis v pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at after upgrading the modem overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old bps modem there are three reasons for the problem the universal asynchronous receiver transmitters uarts used in most pcs are primitive ns devices with single byte fifo buffers if the operating system driver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and the previous one is lost dos being a fairly single minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows can t windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and interrupts often take longer to service overruns are much more likely than under dos as soon as you report to your pc modem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you ll get no useful advice at all most of the store front and mail order sources i spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term and many didn t even know what a uart was even your pc has ns a uarts and ps s do or if you can upgrade your mother com board or add a new com board you may still experience errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers don t take full advantage of the windows is improved in this regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrade applications like procomm win which is what i use cannot get around this problem by themselves if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i wouldn t want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever buy a modem card some modem cards don t even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msd exe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be the hardware situation the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns or ns chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you can t replace them you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program windows msd exe be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a if you run it from a windows dos prompt the ns uart has separate byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to bps although with current modem technology there s no point in pushing your luck by going over bps the has shorted access cycle times than the or the also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an so what uart component do you have try to locate the uart on your mother board multi function i o card com board or isa mca modem card if you can t find a socketed component with the numbers or your com ports are probably buried

chips you can buy plug in ns afn or pc c cn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for to each the n chip is the normal pin dual in line package other styles are available but

them if you don t have socketed chips you ll need to buy an after market com or multi function board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multi function card you ll

fl phone fax com lpt game card w s for i have no personal experience with any of the firms except jdr meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only needed two serial ports and am running out of irqs on my pc so i disabled my built in vlsi based ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com and using irq sharing the software situation simply upgrading to uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems the standard ms serial drivers don t take full advantage of the the windows drivers are even less capable and the windows drivers have the following limitations they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above bps they never enable the transmit fifo which results in an interrupt rate of x during uploads they set the trigger level at bytes too high it s easy for more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to with a v bis modem sparse data and text can easily compress or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of bps would be effective the api won t accept rates above cbr the api won t let dos programs know there is a there and even if it did dos programs that aren t aware get little benefit from a port with the standard drivers they don t allow irq sharing for com the bios doesn t initialize com properly in many systems windows provides no workaround for apps that don t provide port speed options above bps these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after but before rumors suggest they may be solved in windows you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of turbocom current version from bio engineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or voice fax bbs mcimail compuserve price was around as i recall bio eng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check egghead and software list turbocom but as far as i know they don t stock it bio is not a software company per se they apparently needed reliable hi speed serial connections for an in house instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows it is run time licensed i now have my host dte connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed bps i am also using bps when linking an hp lx to my pc with lossless bi directional i o uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers note that is still the highest rate that the windows port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes i also have cts rts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer bit ascii data xon xoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard for xon xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device the byte fifo in the is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xon xoff a well respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the s can t really do cts rts all by itself in the dos windows environment so using data rates above may still be risky even with hardware flow control a with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a co processed com board but this will cost you more than a turbocom upgrade a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb issue of windows sources magazine i suggest trying a turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems closing soapbox comments the state of rs c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry because it is the oldest standard i o interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system that family of machines was subsequently introduced with ports however this is the exception few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent i o you may as well learn what you can about serial i o because this situation shows no sign of improving soon when v fast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users world wide whose pcs sort of work today with v but will fail miserably with v fast without a hardware buffered uart like the and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a v fast modem will be a waste of money regards a east harmony road bob niland suite internet rjn csn

past released new code that incorporates modifications upgrades fixes just as all other software vendors do the level stuff may seem sound now but i assure you changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of competition this allows them to shift people to maintenance as well as design efforts for level q do we duplicate the bugs or do we make it work correctly from the laserwriter to the laserjet there have been bugs if i had a number to call at hp or adobe they ld have heard from me deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate q do we follow the red book or do we follow someone s implementation without a doubt there are differences between the red book and adobe s ps with level many issues have been refined but the red book does leave big big holes in the implementation specific stuff it would be nice it the red bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of adobe s ps don t do the exact opposite given an identical set of conditions q pscript drv having done a lot of ps clone testing myself the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test

issue is convenience i don t like dealing with floppies personally i have no use for changing the registration info but i see it as a valid need and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half hour reinstall that s just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another so while i m not going to put much time into it myself here s the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information copy all your windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it i ve been using c winstall myself from there copy that directory to something like c winorig install from c winstall comp the two directories to determine changes i e comp winorig report txt look in the report file for the file s that change assuming they didn t cover themselves covering their own tracks at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset locate said offset in the original directory and see what s there using a hex editor and do the same for the modified one you re on your own as far as breaking the code goes i don t really do cryptography it s probably just an xor key or something i think ms is more concerned with joe schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with real pirates who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway this technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies lotus stuff is probably like that as i noted before if you can afford the space on the hard disk and don t do much in the way of customization reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous doing

pretty generic you can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter outlinethreshold in the truetype section of win ini this entry specifies the number of pels per em at which windows will render truetype fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts the default is i ve generally been able to get fonts to work by setting outlinethreshold depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using you may need a different value the windows resource kit warns against going above presumably that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something i m not smiling bob nichols

very good review in infoworld i d love to get a real world impression though how is the speed drivers support ntaib silver ucs indiana edu iskandar taib writes the pc world reviewers found out that the herc people had hard coded winbench text into the driver clever no in any case the winbench results are pretty much inflated two things that annoyed me about the pc magazine review their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed as was clearly shown by the graphite and gxe s cheating can t they just admit that their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and or cheat on wintach is much harder to beat the big cheat that hercules iit used was overlappipping bitblit and polyline optimization and hercules sent them a new driver which didn t do this but produced almost identical scores yet the only thing pc magazine says is that scores are not legitimate couldn t they at least make some comment about its real world performance i m not so much going by winbench for performance but rather by steve gibson s results which are more real world based like using micrografx draw to benchmark if you believe gibson that is he writes despite these documented cheats i have to say that in real world applications the hercules graphite adapter actually draws faster than any other display adapter in the industry even though it s just a modest isa bus card it outperformed every local bus adapter i have including the stealth vlb the fahrenheit va vlb the ati vlb mach and even the weitek p based diamond viper vlb this kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it bogus winbench or not when and if you get one send me mail i might buy that ati gu off you i already returned the ati gu my dealer had sold eight of them and seven were returned to him i m now temporarily back to running an original ati gu until i get my graphite and yes the gu is faster in my mb system than the gu especially in bitmap handling that s where you use bitblits hercules has a promotion available for vars and software developers you can buy one graphite or graphite vlb for off list to try it out at just for graphite or for the vlb version i decided it was worth trying i m supposed to get the

figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better pages or more any personal experience on either

truly one way i m guessing half duplex since the host can turn leds on and off are there any chipsets available for communicating with the at keyboard standard other than by cannibalizing a real

gurus feel like attacking this quirk hi there i m having a bizarre video problem within windows i have a with a gvga video board i ve been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes it s screen the problem is that once windows has been envoked the colors start changing themselves at first i thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session you don t have any problems until you get back to windows however when you initially return to windows the original colors get refreshed properly also it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains it s original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple ish black if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows the screen gets refreshed again if i don t log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network everything is fine i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring then from the net to this machine when i ran into problems i deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it again when that didn t work i tried reloading windows to no avail any thoughts on things to check out i am totally baffled thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction linda cornell lcornell u washington edu uw office of

well as multi threading etc i certainly haven t seen this to be the case there are seperate accounts for each person and even seperate directories if that is desired i don t see an implentation of simultaneuos use though scott it certainly is multi user what i have seen from the march beta is that it doesn t yet come with the stuff which exploits multi user features i remember somebody from ms stating that it doesn t allow two users share one gui my interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and rpc based stuff you want i believe ftp and rlogin deamons for nt systems will come from third party somebody already has a beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net there is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on unix for remote logins in general i liked nt when i checked it out it slow compared to win just like any other real os the beta version although being slow botts up much faster than my sun workstation windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than x windows i believe bill gates was right when he stated that nt was not for everybody after playing around with it for a while i was convinced if i owned a busines using a business computer from ibm or some other established vendor i would consider moving to nt platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution if you are running sql servers etc it provides the robustness such an application requires on the other hand if you like your dos games more or less forget about nt you can always boot to dos but in general that defeats the purpose of using nt most of nt s features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can t reboot your machine at will for personal use i would rather wait for the win based windows

well as multi threading etc i certainly haven t seen this to be the case there are seperate accounts for each person and even seperate directories if that is desired i don t see an implentation of simultaneuos use though since running any gui over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount i expect windows nt will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character based apps but graphics based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local cpu this is how things are shaping up everywhere client server architectures are taking over from the old cpu terminal setups note that the next does this you can always telnet into a next and run character based apps but you can t run

where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering to permanently reorder to use the old dbase iii command the records requires sorting the records appropriately no problem since i almost always use them in this order exporting the database to another database which can still be an approach database and then copying the exported files back to the

initialized the problem is in the owner draw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all other pieces of ctrltest work fine two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc the cfile openflags enum uses hard coded numbers for the open mode rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl h which differ between msc and bc all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place of a reference to a derived object true for pointers not for references i am sure there are other problems along the

for three machines each in a different office of the same building each having access to a windows based accounting system my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the machines likely a and two s along with the appropriate ethernet cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit one additional user kit will be necessary it then seems logical to purchase a simple multi user accounting system along the lines of daceasy or m y o b and fire it all up the will more or less act as server with a report check printer attached to it cable runs of

electronically deducted every month from my checking account or is there something that i m not doing right and q can actually do that hi i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the two products i am however a devoted quicken user and i can tell you how to set up the weekly monthly quarterly yearly transactions first use the memorize feature ctrl m to record the recurring transactions next define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used i e monthly quicken will can not automatically make the transactions for you but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once additionally if you are using the bill minder it will remind you when each transaction group is due for example you could have three transaction groups one for payments at the beginning of the month middle of the month and one for quarterly payments i hope this helps

conventional memory hog ver i am considering moving all our machines to w wg q how much conventional ram does w wg use over and above the driver for the network card q if i have a novell ne card are the lsl and ipx drivers still needed q does w wg do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of w wg note i do not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy of w wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one opened copy is much easier than returning n opened

comparitive study of the two programs or can someone just give me their own personal impressions maybe pc magazine january had a review of several personal finance management programe as did pc computing january pc world december also had articles about quicken and managing your money i can email you copies of these articles if you can t find them at your library i ve been using managing your money for several years and i have several friends who use quicken though i ve not used it myself my overall impression is that quicken is a financial accounts manager while managing your money will help you more completely manage your finances here are some features that i believe managing your money and quicken share the ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts checking savings charge cash or brokerage you can reconcile your account statements with the records the program keeps the ability to make a budget and track your spending against that budget a checkfree module which will allow you to use the checkfree bill paying service to pay your bills via your modem the ability to print checks on your printer the ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments the ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts up to date i know managing your money can do this automatically via modem quicken probably can as well but i m not sure about it the ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation programs here are some features that i believe managing your money has that quicken does not a tax prediction module this looks at your accounts and budget to predict your tax liability for the coming year it s usefull to fine tune your withholding so uncle sam doesn t get his due too early an insurance and vital records module this is a place to keep records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records it can also compute your life expectancy a financial analysis module this computes compound interest effects of inflation loan payments term or interest yield to maturity for bonds savings account yields days between dates and loan amortization schedules it also has functions to help you decide whether to refinance your mortgage whether you can afford a particular home whether a particular rental property is a good investment whether you should buy lease or rent and whether a particular investment s cash flow is adequate for your situation this module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping your kids with their tuition a net worth module this is a place to record all your assets and liabilities your net worth can be computed from this information any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules are automatically included here a desk module this includes a small word processor a card file you can use to store names addresses phone numbers and other vital information about friends and associates a perpetual calander a rudimentary calculator a to do list a reminder list an appointment list and a place to record your phone calls for those who need to track such things your appointments reminders and to do list can be made to display automatically when you start the program there are probably some things listed above that quicken has but i m almost sure that quicken doesn t do everything i ve listed if i m wrong i m sure hordes of quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp one thing that quicken has that managing your money does not yet have is a windows version meca software is rumored to be working on a windows version of managing your money for release late this year i hope this information is of use to you i ve found managing your money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records on the other hand i know many people who are equally as happy with quicken if quicken has all the features you need or want i d go with it if you find any of the managing your money features that quicken doesn t have to be useful i think

depends on who you ask and how you define mature system is if anything less mature than windows days ago people doubted that ms windows is not a real os i can see why they have such question ms windows confuses many people microsoft simulated mac but it did a lousy job for example you can not create hierarchy groups there is no way to create a group in a group if you know how please tell me so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under the apple menu everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of the program manager if you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available uncomplete documentation it s not easy to find the reason why causes an unpredictable error and this is easy on a mac give me a break having spent hours moving system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time i find this laughable group deleting file deleting after deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files but if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full of nonsense files oh great ever hear of aliases wonder why apple implemented them share problem once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some language w o good editor there will be a sharing problem you just can not open or save the program if it is loaded it makes sense to prevent from saving but not opening eh i don t follow it s by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if microsoft want to keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products

while now we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway you also need a tcp ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that s what they require to get the smtp gateway to work you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do there is a glitch somewhere in the system though i don t know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent the scenario is this the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem if anyone wants to get help it is only for one support call until problem is worked out phooey to that i say i am looking vigorously for a better idea if

drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months i am interested in the faster mathcad but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsoft s claim about increased speed to sx users will mathcad run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file so far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by e mail appear to be by fuess llnl gov david a fuess according to mathsoft no mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical resources they say this is actually a win s feature a figure of mb was indicated to me as a minimum but you might try anyway by bert tyler satalink com bert tyler i m not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here i have a dx with mb of main memory less mb for a ramdisk and a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process which i have been running without any swapfile when i installed the win s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win s subsystem itself demanded the presence of a swapfile the only win s program i ve run to date is the bit version of freecell that came with that subsystem i gave windows a small temporary swapfile i m leery of files that must remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well by bca ece cmu edu brian c anderson what is win i upgraded to mathcad and it installed a directory for win under windows system during the upgrade it told me that win was required by case student tc umn edu steven v case mathcad makes use of the win s libraries you ve probably heard about win s it is a bit windows library that provides much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and multitasking and such but can be run under windows by rhynetc zardoz chem appstate edu thomas c rhyne i also have mb of ram and indeed mathcad insisted on a permanent swapfile it would not run otherwise by bishop baeyer chem fsu edu greg bishop mathcad absolutely requires mb ram with mb swap file or mb ram with mb swap file it will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file is less than mb it is a major resource hog if you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about mb of ram real or virtual just to load again due to the win s libraries so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsoft s advertisement for that you need a swap file possibly as big as mb looks like i would just need an mb swap file and would need to choose or can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file apparently a win subsystem ships with mathcad how much disk space does this require i also received these answers by mfdjh uxa ecn bgu edu dale hample if you ve got megs of ram why not configure megs as a ram disk for mathcad dos permits different bootup configurations can mathcad win be configured to use such a ram drive instead of a swap file if not i don t see how using dos for an alternate bootup would provide windows with this swap file some time back i remember a discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file but i thought this involved slower mb systems i have dos but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation by the way is a full installation of dos required to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature which files from the installation disks are required by wild access digex com wildstrom presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file if windows needs a swap file it will upo and create

running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all applications exit windows and restart your computer error gawd i love windows is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches you ll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh data files should be examined and repaired what might have caused this does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable i m suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing you re not stupid smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things a reasonably accurate prediction here s a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file the directory entry the fat chain and the data area you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of x cards the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number it also holds some other information that s not important right now the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data each square of graph paper holds a number if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file the data area x cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each in your case one cluster is bytes as a cluster is filled another is allocated to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says it s the last cluster in the file chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission it doesn t have any intelligence so you have to double check anything it fixes now let s do a bit of a post mortem c gfx vpic cvpic exe c gfx vpic vpic txt c gfx vpic video cfg c gfx vpic orcpro cfg c gfx vpic vga cfg c game goose bird x c winmisc adv winadv exe allocation error size adjusted all of these files have sizes according to the fat which don t match the size reported in their directory entries chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size in other words the directory entry for cvpic exe may say the file is bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of clusters attached to it my numbers obviously are made up lost allocation units found in chains bytes disk space would be freed disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files you can then examine the files file chk through file chk and rename or discard them or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat c gfx vpic cvpic exe is cross linked on allocation unit c spart par is cross linked on allocation unit these files are both referencing the same data cluster obviously one of them at least must be wrong it s interesting to note that c spart par is your windows swap file to fix this you should copy each cross linked file to a new name this will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the cross linked files examine the copies and try to assemble them properly good luck hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top bytes total disk space bytes in hidden files bytes in directories bytes in user files bytes available on disk your disk is pretty close to full this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs sorry gordon

confirmation of some opinions this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied the card does not work in a system with m ram a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know the vlb and eisa version should have no problems b i m pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesn t work in systems with over m ram there is supposed to be way of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this but apparently it doesn t work i posted some help me messages on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didn t have this problem c false d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over m by using their configuration software no messing with jumpers necessary the m problem is probably valid only for isa cards the card works in a m system with some switches set but it is much slower a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than m ram eisa and vlb or m isa m should not be a problem for you b dunno c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus the card is interlaced in its bit true colour modes a nope i can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all non interlaced b yes according to pc magazine they ve tested a local bus version that does x in bit which may or may not be interlaced c not for the pro sometimes for the plus some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to do with bits only with screen size note that for bit color and windows you must have megs memory size calculations notwithstanding the latest build drivers still do not work in many cases a they aren t perfect but are much improved i don t recall the last time which i had to leave mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due to software incompatibility b true many people recommended going back to build or c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain graphs with dashed lines in mathcad do not print correctly though they do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards other accelerated cards also have bugs d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory i am running the color mode as that is all my nt driver for october nt version seems to allow i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old driver this card is the fastest full colour card for the money a it s quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate b yes i ll admit it was very very fast in bit mode which is what i wanted to use it for too bad it crashed in many different ways every minutes or so c depends on many many things this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread a i like it b well pc magazine seems to think it is c yes this appears to be true d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it better cards are coming out who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was developing at that time pc magazine about two months or so back overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i don t have an graphics ultra yet ati graphics ultra plus accelerated x at k colours true colour m at x multimedia video acceleration for indeo video rle and video compressed stretch full motion video windows to full size fast vga includes button mouse isa versions only anti aliased fonts ed avail in colour mode only i think real time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop around a length card size priced from u s ati graphics ultra pro everything in graphics ultra plus faster performance with vrams accelerated x at colours hz non interlaced available in isa eisa and microchannel priced from u s ati technologies i hope this summary can be of use

a dx computer with a soundblaster card i m running microsoft windows v i have the sb driver set up properly to play normal sounds wav files etc i want to play midi files through the media player that is included with windows i know i have to set up the patch maps or something in the midi mapper in the control panel i know nothing about midi this is to be the way i ll get my feet wet how do i set up windows so that i can play midi files if you install the soundblaster windows drivers correctly and have the latest drivers the media player should be setup to play files authored to microsoft s multimedia midi authoring standard general midi see the section in the back of the voyetra manual in the soundblaster midi upgrade kit you ll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different mappings so don t expect them to always sound correct without using some kind of midi file editor such as voyetra s sequencer plus you can attempt to use the midi mapper to remap the patches for soundblaster but since you cannot modify the sbfm drv you are allways stuck with the instruments that come with this driver unless you can find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in sbfm drv i would suggest you locate the early version of soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt voices and the later drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices david thomas

have the autoexec bat copy the win ini and system ini files and change directories for them when they exit windows it can copy back generic ini files if you want this is the only way i can think of

writes so good that there isn t any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies and tt there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm otherwise it is a waste of system resources or if you need to use a service bureau and they re only set up to use type fonts from what i ve heard pure hearsay the results of outputting tt fonts as type is not as good as using high quality type fonts in the first place unless you print to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device image setter a problem with tt fonts in windows is that they do get converted to t format ok and the hinting is even used while this is done but the resulting t fonts are not hinted the result is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the ps file is generated but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution so when you print to an attached ps printer with the ps driver set up for this printer results may be quite good but if you take a ps file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution such as an image setter then the results may not be so goodwinqvt net v an earlier article in this newsgroup made reference to winqvt net version realy

domesticworkspace managers for win a small review thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows i found shareware workspace managers from australia s ms windows archive monu cc monash edu au which mirrors some sites in the u s the three i found were workspaces wspace zip this was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that i found it is very easy to use it displays a small window containing buttons plus an extra button for configuration purposes one annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run you must press a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away also it would have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons maybe some user specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package workshift wrksft zip while this workspace manager offered a few features that workspaces lacked it was quite time consuming to set things up with workspaces all but the first workspace is initially empty with workshift you need to take snapshots of how you want each of your workspaces to look like i e what applications they contain also the main window is quite large but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace with workspaces there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it workshift provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful bigdesk and backmenu backdesk zip this is an interesting package which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager other goodies include backmenu which provides a pop up root menu when you press a certain mouse button just like in x windows the menu is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus which is provides quite handy access to applications you could say it is a menu based alternative to the program manager also bundled in backdesk zip is a program called wrun which allows you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows instead of using the file manager to run applications the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk bigdesk works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesn t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces in fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on this means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one the bigdesk control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow up of a particular section try each of them out for yourself i was impressed with all of them so find out which one suits your needs the bestre wp pcf linux risc in article c rx b kzp ecf toronto edu leebr ecf toronto edu lee

addressing modes risc instruction sets are not as orthogonal is cisc theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer that s why everyone is arguing about risc v s cisc personally i think cisc will win out just take a look at the pentium not that i like intel architectures either but that s another story bye do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc or that it will outsell them all if the first you have to remember that intel cisc like the pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also riscs cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not

nt tm is a multi user os as well as multi threading etc i certainly haven t seen this to be the case there are seperate accounts for each person and even seperate directories if that is desired i don t see an implentation of simultaneuos use though since running any gui over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount i expect windows nt will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character based apps but graphics based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local cpu this is how things are shaping up everywhere client server architectures are taking over from the old cpu terminal setups note that the next does this you can always telnet into a next and run character based

vertical motion is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can t click on something because my mouse jumps around i can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump again maybe this time to the left about inch this is crazy i have never had so much trouble with a mouse before anyone have any solutions does microsoft think they are what everyone should be just venting steam i had the same problem at first i thought it was the video driver and made sure i had the most current drivers because the problem was most evident at svga resolution modes it didn t help and after a bit of experimentation determined that the problem existed in standard vga resolution mode it was just much less noticeable my mouse was an older ms serial version i bought second hand in it worked just fine in dos and dos based graphic applications on the guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse i borrowed a new mouse a ms bus model and tried it that solved the problem so if your mouse is old you may want to try replacing it for a newer one sean

environment space running bat files from windows i have a bat file that i run under a windows icon i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable my problem is that on some of our machines running ms dos and windows in enhanced mode the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error i have raised the amount of environment space to bytes using the shell command in config sys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out from the windows resource toolkit for win workgroups add an entry to your system ini file under the nonwindowsapp section commandenvsize nnnn this sets the command com env size where nnnn must either be or between and a value of disables the setting if this value is too small or too big it is rounded up to or down to if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled as if it were if you specify the environment size in a pif file for command com the pif setting overrides this setting the default is with msdos versions earlier than otherwise the default value is the e option in the shell command in config sys to set this value you must edit your system ini and reboot i have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from the config sys shell line and both give larger environments if you don t use one of these then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment variables present when windows was started no matter how big the dos env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes this should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary jerome jerry schneider domain

edu tw ghhwang csie nctu edu tw ghhwang writes dear friend the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about computer architecture for more information about risc hmm not that i am an authority on risc but i clearly remember reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large the difference is in addressing modes risc instruction sets are not as orthogonal is cisc theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer that s why everyone is arguing about risc v s cisc personally i think cisc will win out just take a look at the pentium not that i like intel architectures either but that s another story bye do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc or that it will outsell them all if the first you have to remember that intel cisc like the pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also riscs cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not even on the same order but i remember reading about years maybe about a t from hypercube that did a mips was superscallar and reordered its instruction itself so i m not sure but i think the t was a mhz transputer so ya tie a gazillion of them together to get mips the newest is the t which kicks anyone s butt haven t seen them used much though anyway to respond i think the pentium cisc is better than the more advanced risc e g like the alpha etc the mhz pentium has approximately the same performance as the superduper mhz alpha here performance is the weird specint that everyone refers to this is what i heard the alpha still kicks in the p s butt in fp again this is what i heard and in the computing world if you sell lots of chips like intel and make it faster like intel you are the winner like intel even though you have a sucky architecture from over years ago like intel if you can make a cisc chip superscalar superduperpipelined superfast with the ideas behind the risc ideology you got a cisc chip and then i admit i can t see the advantages of risc over cisc if the latest technology is a generation behind then it sucks relatively speaking now i may sound like i like intel but i ll have to say that the p is some real kick butt pile of si and sio but i hope that motorola

bubblejet and hp deskjet keywords printer date apr gmt hello fellow netters i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj bubblejet vs the hp deskjet i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here which works better under windows any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and

average salesguy i ll give your question a shot the key issue that i bought my bj on was ink drying speed you really have to try awful hard to get the bj ink to smear the hp deskjets need seconds to completely dry in both cases however do not get your pages wet unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not toner but that should go without saying my pc has very little memory only meg ram so the bj takes a little while to print but every application i use takes a while to run once the computer is solely printing it purs like a kitten and puts pages out every seconds depending on how detailed your graphics are the bj can do windows soft fonts i m assuming that the deskjet can or hp wouldn t sell many size is another factor the bj is much smaller but the hp is built like a tank i bet the bj would get damaged first finally the print quality i love the bj s resolution it looks like a good laser quality print the hp s i ve used they look like ink not as impressive so i chose the canon any other opinionsactix video card drivers for windows i am looking for the latest drivers for the actix graphics accelerator card the driver i am currently using is version and doesn t

that are loaded protman bytes driver bytes workgrp bytes q if i have a novell ne card are the lsl and ipx drivers still needed no w wg uses it s own drivers q does w wg do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of w wg note i do not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy of w wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies not that i know of i bought two copies had some problems with one installed both from the same copie no problems do worry i just had a really old bios and that s the only problem i got q if you buy the upgrade to windows for w wg does it replace all of win as you

using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however during this process i have come up with new problems there seems to be a limit of characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names but how is one meant to update a database a a dde sql update command does not seem to work b initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel is initiated i guess c access does not allow vb to dde poke the information the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of key strokes vb sends are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions are there any better work arounds to the above are there any signs of an odbc driver for access bob ran doc ic ac ukvideo cards with bnc connectors hello i just

com was using i think but switched to to see if it was any better vertical motion is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can t click on something because my mouse jumps around i can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump again maybe this time to the left about inch this is crazy i have never had so much trouble with a mouse before anyone have any solutions does microsoft think they are what everyone should be just venting steam i think i have the same problem i think it is caused by the rubber ball in the mouse which doesn t roll so smooth the detectors in the mouse notice this and whoops i hit a mine using minesweeper i think the solution will be buying a new mouse and or using a mouse pad wouter and or taking the rubber ball out of the mouse should be directions in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse and cleaning it with alcohol isopropyl i believe the same alcohol as used for cleaning your cassette deck this is good to do every so often even if you have a mouse pad dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the rubber ball as well lint and other garbage may find it s way onto the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and vertical sensors hope this helps good luck sincerely robert kayman kayman cs

database c libraries well i m amazed at how successful this exercise was i received responses and requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and q e codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql q e is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other products mentioned were microsoft s odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and q e only odbc quadbase rbase and q e have sql for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files however i feel that microsoft s odbc looks very promising it s mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say it s available via ftp except it s effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmer s reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesn t actually interpret sql and liase with databases that s up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also it s windows only it s actually an extension to the windows sdk nevertheless it s a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future here s my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs i d really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it to a function which returns the query results in some format failing that any other access would still be better than nothing i d also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing if other people are interested i ll prepare a summary of what i m told and post it thanks to all borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want the current version is which is fully compatible with ack paradox why the versions are different i don t know pd engine was compatible with pdox and it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now reading the box it s borland paradox engine database frameworks works with any borland c c mocrosoft c or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal or later tp for windows or later for framework applications bc or later or ms c c it does have support for object useage i haven t had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly complete i

drive paradox installed on a novell network netware v or greater dos win but the program will not load in enchanted mode the thermometer bar goes to and we then either get a invalid command com or a windows nastygram talking about an illegal instruction i ve checked out the command com thing but as a long time c programmer i ve crashed my share of machines with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior anyway paradox will run in standard mode but not enhanced we also have quattro pro windows exhibiting the same behavior spent about hours with borland s tech people with no avail the

vertical motion is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can t click on something because my mouse jumps around i can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump again maybe this time to the left about inch this is crazy i have never had so much trouble with a mouse before anyone have any solutions try this flip your mouse over and open up the cover that holds the mouse ball in place remove the ball and inside you should see probably rollers if any of the rollers have a tiny layer of caked on dirt dust or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them carefully scrape it off with a small knife xacto works great be careful you do not want to gauge the rollers just clean off the dirt put the ball back in put the cover on and there you are i clean a couple of dozen of these every month here another symptom is that when you move the mouse it seems to click along if this doesn t solve your problem at least you have a clean mouse i highly recommend using a proper soft mouse pad and if you are a clean freak place it in your drawer every night or when you don t use it to keep the dust off personally i prefer track balls oh which brings me to another point if your mouse or trackball tracks optically and the sunlight is streaming through the window onto your mouse trackball you may notice that it will stop working if this happens to you close the curtains or blinds or simply shade your pointing device and see if that helps peter

appreciate if you can email or post you positive or negative experience with this monitor especially compared to to nanao i i d summarize if i got multiple responses i bought a viewsonic for use at home but after a week i took it back i felt for the money my nec fg that i use at work was a much better monitor the nec is sharper flatter less distorted and more stable i have heard complaints from people about the nec fg series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all there was nothing really broken with the viewsonic but overall it did not match up i used my ati graphics ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the viewsonic exhibited some problems that the nec did not i personally like the non etched nec with the ocli filter and the tube on the was not as nice the had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems also it would change brightness when i switched modes and i was constantly having to fiddle with the controls and the yoke was crooked and i had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill on the postive side although not as handsome as the nec the had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy i have heard that panasonic owns viewsonic and the model is being sold through oem channels with a panasonic label on it if it s available that way at a lower cost i could get more serious about it for now the nec has my vote but i m searching for one of the new cheaper nec fge s to see if it s just as good as its older brother the fg before i decide which one to buy i have no experience with the nanao i can never keep the nanao models straight and don t have any place i can walk in to get a good comparison of all models standard employer disclaimers apply

the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt this is a second rfd replacing the one originally posted in january and never taken to a vote the proposed groups are described below name comp os ms windows nt setup status unmoderated purpose discussions about setting up and installing windows nt and about system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt name comp os ms windows nt misc status unmoderated purpose miscellaneous non programming discussions about using windows nt including issues such as security networking features console mode and windows win compatability rationale microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an os the family ranges from modular windows through windows and windows for workgroups to windows nt at the high end to date microsoft has shipped over beta copies and pre release sdks of windows nt the actual release is slated for may june while windows nt has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the windows family its win api includes the win api used in win dows and the win s api subset win less threads networking and security can be used to create bit applications for windows the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows with the addition of logins and a few other features it uses program manager file manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user many of the announced windows nt applications are ports of existing windows apps and nt also runs existing applications thus it appears logical that windows nt should share the following groups with the other members of the windows family comp os ms windows apps comp os ms windows programmer tools comp os ms windows programmer misc comp os ms windows programmer win the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as well as windows comp os ms windows announce comp os ms windows advocacy in conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the windows and windows nt hierarchies is different internal structures of windows and windows nt and yet operating systems such as os macintosh os xenix and coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies further windows is due for a major rewrite itself in when the fully bit protected mode and with dos built in next generation windows chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy and what then would be the jus tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions discussion period the discussion period will run from april to may voting the cfv call for votes will be issued around may based on the feedback received during the discussion period no votes will be accepted prior to the cfv tom haapanen tomh metrics com software
